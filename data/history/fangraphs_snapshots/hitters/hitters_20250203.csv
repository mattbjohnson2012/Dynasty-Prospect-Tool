He slashed .263/.361/.531 with 21 homers, 19 steals, and a 21.3/12.3 K%/BB% in 95 games at Triple-A, and then he popped 3 homers with a 125 wRC+ in 57 MLB PA. The underlying numbers weren’t bad either, but they weren’t quite as impressive with a 86.8 MPH EV at Triple-A, and a 41.9% whiff% and 34.7% Chase% in the majors. Granted, he did crush the ball in the majors with a 14.7% Barrel%, and he definitely has some legit raw juice in his bat. He ran a lot in the minors, but he wasn’t a particularly good base stealer, and he’s not a burner, so while he’ll likely contribute in the category, I wouldn’t expect big totals. He seems like a bench bat to me optimally, but San Diego is thin, so he’s not far away from playing time. – 2025 Projection: 29/8/34/.241/.298/.417/4",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.08695652173913043,0.6956521739130435,0.21739130434782608,0.5652173913043478,0.30434782608695654,34.0,,,,24.90272373540856,1,0.25,19.299610894941633,28.85486381322957,1.0,Unknown,,,40.0,34.85645914396888,27.0,Contact,29.635406614785996,19964,playerId

It’s great for real life, but it makes it very hard to know if and when a good but not great prospect will get an opportunity. Rodriguez is in that bucket as a slugger with no defensive value. He destroyed Triple-A, slashing .301/.390/.540 with 29 homers, 8 steals, and a 25.2/12.6 K%/BB% in 118 games. The 7.2 degree launch was low, but the 92.5 MPH EV more than made up for it. He didn’t have a good MLB debut in a small sample with a .486 OPS in 40 PA, but he still put up a 91.3 MPH EV.

I don’t know who is going to emerge out of this group, but at least a few of them will emerge over the next few years, and the ones that do can definitely make an impact. Valera had injuries slow his career and allowed others to catch up to him on the depth chart, so now he’s in a dog fight like the rest of them. He had a strong year in 2024 with 17 homers, a 90.5 MPH EV and 27/12 K%/BB% in 90 games at Triple-A, showing off the power potential. He still has that damn smooth lefty swing. The best way to play Cleveland’s fringier prospects are to probably wait to see who gets the opportunity, and then pounce, rather than hold on, but in deeper leagues you probably don’t have that luxury. Something tells me that I still want to bet on Valera, but it will probably come as a strong side of a platoon bat. – 2025 Projection: 15/6/21/.221/.301/.424/1 Prime Projection: 66/23/73/.245/.327/.469/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8627450980392157,0.8169934640522876,0.738562091503268,0.8823529411764706,0.4771241830065359,77.78,,14.28571428571429,,32.295719844357976,2,0.5,21.072818232351306,57.93248638132296,0.68,MLB,-3.302777800000001,89.63333360000001,47.0,73.60374595439689,30.0,Power+OBP,55.94835239947861,22541,playerId

He moved methodically through the system with solid but not stellar results and was left unprotected and unpicked in the Rule 5 Draft three times after first becoming eligible in 2021. Playing for Triple-A El Paso for a third straight season in 2024, he had his best year yet with a .297/.367/.497 line and career-high 23 homers (10th-most in the Pacific Coast League) in 128 games. He was added to the 40-man roster in July as outfield depth but never debuted and continued to produce in winter ball back home in Mexico. The left-handed slugger’s increased power output in ’24 wasn’t just a product of the hitter-friendly environs of El Paso or the PCL as a whole. His exit velocities ran above average, including his 104.8 mph 90th-percentile EV. It’s all-fields pop too, but what keeps Ornelas, who bats from an open stance with a leg kick, from a true 55-grade power projection is that he still hits the ball on the ground more than is desired. Otherwise, he doesn’t whiff on many pitches across the board and had almost even splits, though he will expand the zone in search of contact. Ornelas is a below-average runner, and his average arm strength meant he got the lion’s share of work in left field in 2024. He also sprinkled in some first base in August and September, notably after the 40-man add. He got his Major League debut at long last in 2025, but a bout of plantar fasciitis kept him out of San Diego's outfield equation for much of the summer.

The 6’4”, sweet lefty swinging Ornelas slashed .297/.367/.497 with 23 homers, 7 steals, and a 16.1/9.7 K%/BB% in 128 games at Triple-A. The 87.6 MPH EV and 8.4 degree launch don’t exactly scream big time power hitter in the majors, but the raw power is definitely in there, and the contact rates were really good. It’s probably a bench bat long term, but San Diego is a very thin team right now, so Ornelas is in position to get plenty of at-bats in 2025. It’s also not out of the question for him to level up again if he can raise his launch, and his teammate Jackson Merrill is a perfect guy to talk to about that. He’s not a bad underrated proximity bat at all for deeper leagues. – 2025 Projection: 41/10/47/.238/.303/.409/2 Prime Projection: 43/12/51/.260/.321/.435/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.39215686274509803,0.35294117647058826,0.6601307189542484,0.45751633986928103,0.738562091503268,49.6,62.96296296296296,0.0,0.0,57.19844357976653,4,1.0,35.760195993659025,44.75606859778066,1.0,MLB,-2.630555600000001,81.56666720000001,85.0,52.941820659334205,12.0,OBP,55.3371527367004,22566,playerId

It was in a small sample (40 swings), but that was 4th best in all of baseball. My eyes certainly weren’t deceiving me, and it’s what keeps Canario interesting to me for fantasy. He’s going to rip dingers if he gets playing time, like he did at Triple-A with 18 homers and a 16.8% Barrel% in 64 games. He also keeps producing in the majors in small samples (despite an extremely high K%) with a 148 wRC+ in 17 PA in 2023 and a 128 wRC+ in 28 PA in 2024. The swing is on the long side and he strikes out a ton (30.4% K% at Triple-A), so the batting average is a major risk, and it may prevent him from ever really truly locking down a full time job, but that power upside is big enough to crack this list. 2025 Projection: 28/10/37/.223/.301/.438/2 Prime Projection: 64/25/78/.235/.314/.469/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.08695652173913049,88.13,,,,34.04669260700389,1,0.25,26.38618677042801,66.5196653696498,0.172,Unknown,,,19.3,75.92739961089494,47.7,Power+OBP,40.87232982490272,22842,playerId

He was doing his usual big power, big strikeout thing before going down with the injury with 10 homers and a 32.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 40 games at Triple-A. That K rate at Triple-A is scary, and it was even worse when he got a shot in the majors in 2023 with a 38.8% K% and 43.1% whiff%. But strikeouts aside, Pereira is an exciting talent with the ability to crush the ball and above average speed. He’s basically obliterated every stop of the minors. These guys generally get a shot at some point in time, often with the Miami Marlins of the world, and the fantasy upside is worth staying patient with. With Juan Soto now officially a goner, maybe Pereira’s status in the Yankees organization gets a little bump, and even if he isn’t handed a starting job (which he won’t be), he might hang around in that next man up territory. He’s a bit more interesting to me now than he was before Soto signing with the Mets. 2025 Projection: 28/10/35/.222/.291/.424/5 Prime Projection: 71/24/78/.235/.312/.454/12 Update: Stanton injury could open the door a crack for Pereira",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.738562091503268,0.869281045751634,0.48366013071895425,0.7712418300653595,0.11764705882352944,63.48,,,,56.809338521400775,1,0.25,44.02723735408559,56.67153307392996,1.0,MLB,-3.7111112000000013,94.53333440000002,40.0,66.09546008217899,27.0,Power+OBP,52.59962391698055,23695,playerId

Mauricio missed all of 2024 after undergoing surgery for a torn ACL that he suffered after a non contact injury on the bases in Winter Ball. It was deju vu all over again with Edwin Diaz tearing his knee in the WBC the off-season before that, but Diaz came back to basically full strength this season, and Mauricio can do the same in 2025. He hit the ball very hard with a 90.7 MPH EV in 26 games in the majors and a 91.1 MPH EV at Triple-A, he loves to run with 7 steals in the majors and 24 steals at Triple-A, and he gets the bat on the ball with a 18.2% K% at Triple-A. That K% jumped to 28.7% in the majors, he chases a ton, he hits the ball on the ground a lot and despite loving to run, he’s not a burner. He doesn’t really have the speed to lose, so the knee injury is definitely concerning in the stolen base department at the least..

He put up a 59 wRC+ with a 34.6/6.2 K%/BB%, 0 homers, and 0 steals in 81 MLB PA. And at AAA he slashed .250/.380/.380 in 83 games. He’s not good on defense, the hit tool is below average at best, and he’s not fast with average speed. Power was always his main selling point, and that is still present with a plus 73.7 MPH swing and 89.8 MPH EV at Triple-A, but the launch is relatively low, he doesn’t particularly pull it a ton, and SF is just a deadly ballpark for power hitters. He’s also been passed on the depth chart, so he doesn’t have a clear path to playing time at the moment. Without much defensive value, hit tool problems, little speed, no starting job, and good but not great power, I just don’t see him as a very unique or valuable player right now. He’s still on the radar, he has legit power, and he’s young, so I’m not giving up on him completely, but this is as high as I can go. – 2025 Projection: 28/7/24/.234/.310/.400/2 Prime Projection: 68/24/73/.248/.322/437/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.22875816993464052,0.6143790849673203,0.28104575163398693,0.3006535947712418,0.08496732026143794,31.58,,,,54.86381322957199,1,0.25,42.519455252918284,35.4088093385214,1.0,MLB,-4.208333400000001,100.0,40.0,42.991642801556424,27.0,Power,43.29623926070039,25616,playerId

Despite the poor MLB debut, he put up a 20.4% K%, 25.5% Chase%, a 90.1 MPH EV, an 11.8 degree launch, and a 28.7 ft/sec sprint speed. For a bad debut, that is a damn good collection of numbers. He was also getting hot at Triple-A towards the end of his stay there with 7 homers and a .894 OPS in his final 37 games, which shows you to not get too hung up on the down minor league numbers either. Chicago has nothing but opportunity, so they are going to give him every chance to establish himself. He might not be a league winner, but 20+ homers with a decent BA and a handful of steals is more than useful in most fantasy leagues. – 2025 Projection: 41/13/52/.233/.292/.403/4 Prime Projection: 71/23/80/.252/.318/.450/8",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.13071895424836602,0.48366013071895425,0.16993464052287582,0.28104575163398693,0.5032679738562091,28.5,,,,73.92996108949417,1,0.25,57.295719844357976,38.57850194552529,1.0,MLB,-4.6333334000000015,100.0,40.0,42.24855058365759,27.0,Power,42.96184776264592,25621,playerId

He led the Minor Leagues with 86 home runs between the 2021 and 2023 seasons, topping out with 30 for Double-A New Hampshire in his age-20 season of 2022, and he pushed his way to the Majors for one game on June 21, 2024 after a solid start at Triple-A Buffalo. He was suspended 80 games after testing positive for the banned substance Clomiphene. He returned to the International League in early September but didn’t make it back to the bigs. Martinez was designated for assignment and released by the Blue Jays in September 2025 and signed with the Nationals on a Minor League deal shortly after. Martinez had been young for every level he’s played at in his career. His raw power took a step back in 2025 but still checked in generally above-average. His pull-and-air-heavy approach helps that loud contact play over the fence, and he’s always geared up to hit the fastball. He struggles immensely against secondary pitches, however -- a trend that's continued into 2025 -- and you can bet Major League pitchers would take advantage. Martinez is a below-average runner, and that lack of footspeed has caused him to move around the infield. Originally signed as a shortstop, he slid over to third base, where he had the arm strength for the position, and started seeing more time at second in 2023 when the Jays wanted him to have more reaction time to balls off the bat. He remains fringy at all spots. Martinez is a clear change-of-scenery candidate but needs work on both sides of the ball to live up to his potential as a former Top 100 prospect.

I didn’t dock Tatis much for his PED suspension, and that turned out to be a good move. But Tatis was an established MLB superstar already. I then followed suit by not docking Noelvi Marte much, and that looks like a mistake with him possibly being the worst player in MLB last year, dropping off everywhere you look. Martinez clearly fits better into the Noelvi mold than Tatis mold, but everyone is their own person, and I don’t want Marte’s season to influence Martinez’ ranking too much for me. Martinez returned in September and he put up a .882 OPS with 1 homer in 11 games at Triple-A, so that is a good sign that the suspension won’t impact him that much. And before the suspension, he was beasting the league with 17 homers, a 13.1% Barrel%, 46.1% Hard Hit%, 23.8/8.5 K%/BB%, and a 120 wRC+ in 74 games. His power is no joke with 30+ potential on the MLB level. Toronto traded for Gimenez, but 3B is still open for the taking, and it wouldn’t be crazy to see Martinez win that role pretty quickly into 2025 (pending any off-season moves). I’m going to stay a bit restrained here because of the suspension, but I don’t want to be overly scared off. This is a big time power bat who is knocking on the door of the bigs with opportunity. I’m cautiously buying. – 2025 Projection: 36/12/43/.229/.298/.422/1 Prime Projection: 76/28/87/.247/.323/.477/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.12418300653594772,0.43790849673202614,0.10457516339869281,0.1437908496732026,0.15032679738562094,19.48,0.0,,6.666666666666665,86.7704280155642,3,0.75,38.68923476005188,26.20323216601816,1.0,MLB,-4.3194444999999995,100.0,70.0,33.574969649805446,17.0,Power,46.55873634241245,25967,playerId

He made his big league debut in the final week of the season, going 1-for-10 in three starts. At 6-foot-6, Alcántara has a naturally long right-handed swing, though it comes with plenty of bat speed and produces impressive exit velocities. He has at least 30-homer upside and can drive the ball out of any part of the ballpark, but he has yet to go deep more than 15 times in a season because he chases too many pitches out of the zone and struggles to do damage against non-fastballs. He's at his best when he focuses on making hard contact, but he'll lapse into trying to do too much and produces a lot of rolled-over ground balls. Alcántara offers a combination of size and athleticism that few players can match. Though it takes him a while to get out of the batter's box, he's a plus runner once he gets going and can be at least a 20/20 player if he takes more chances on the bases. He continues to improve defensively, and he's a quality center fielder with good instincts and a strong arm.

He’s a still projectable 6’6”, 188 pounds with a double plus raw power/speed combo. He put up a 91 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 29.2 ft/sec sprint in the majors. And it’s not like he’s struggled in the minors at all, He’s actually been extremely good his entire career, never putting up a wRC+ under 123 at any stop other than when he was a 16 year old in rookie ball. This year he did it in the upper minors all season as a 21/22 year old, slashing .278/.353/.428 with 14 homers, 14 steals, and a 26.0/9.9 K%/BB% in 111 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. The cherry on top is that he’s a good CF, which could make a potent OF with PCA in center and Alcantara in a corner down the line. He’s not a finished product with hit tool risk and too many groundballs, but his hype should be so much higher than it is. Alcantara makes for a great upside target. 2025 Projection: 22/7/29/.229/.294/.407/6 Prime Projection: 79/23/78/.251/.328/.449/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.39869281045751637,0.6078431372549019,0.37254901960784315,0.5228758169934641,0.07189542483660127,41.26,83.33333333333334,68.75,,90.27237354085604,3,0.75,75.75876678492409,53.33456837472343,1.0,MLB,-4.966666700000001,100.0,70.0,53.69337051241703,17.0,Power,55.61201673058767,25971,playerId

It’s also not the first time he’s had a huge season. He had a big time year in 2022 as well. His numbers dropped off at Triple-A, but he still performed well with a 107 wRC+, 5 homers, 7 steals, and a 27.0/8.5 K%/BB% in 35 games. His raw power is currently below average with a 86.5 MPH EV, but there is still some projection on his frame at 6’1”, so that can easily tick up in his mid 20’s, and best of all, he’s a lift and pull machine, so he’ll get the most out of his raw power. He also has good speed and went 16 for 17 on the bases in 79 total games. The hit tool is below average and the talent probably isn’t quite big enough to just overlook that, but a lift and pull profile with speed is very fantasy friendly, and he’s knocking on the door of the bigs. I’m starting to like Lugo a decent amount in medium to deeper leagues as proximity play. 2025 Projection: 21/5/28/.229/.290/390/3 Prime Projection: 76/19/74/.246/.313/.420/11",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.16993464052287582,0.49673202614379086,0.2222222222222222,0.4444444444444444,0.11111111111111116,28.14,,,0.0,66.14785992217898,2,0.5,39.35797665369649,32.06629182879377,1.0,MLB,-3.7916667000000004,95.5000004,55.0,39.42188760863813,22.0,Power,44.53984950388716,25980,playerId

The Marlins signed them both five months later, with Victor Victor getting $5.25 million but never hitting before his career topped out in Triple-A and Victor Jr. receiving $1 million. The latter slashed .259/.319/.430 in Triple-A at age 22 last season before a July back injury ended his season prematurely. Once projected as a hit-over-power guy, Mesa has reversed that profile since arriving in Double-A in 2023, looking to launch balls to his pull side with a more aggressive and uphill left-handed stroke. His chase rate jumped to an untenable 41 percent last year, mitigating his feel for the barrel and leading to suboptimal contact when he expands the zone. He is driving the ball more often and has the bat speed and strength to produce 20 homers annually. Interestingly, he has been much more productive against same-side pitchers during the last two seasons. Growing up around the game, Mesa developed a high baseball IQ and plays much quicker than his average speed. He's an opportunistic baserunner if not much of a basestealer, and he chases down balls in center field with smart reads and routes. He's a plus defender with the solid arm strength to play anywhere in the outfield.

And Hernaiz is good enough to keep the pressure on all 3 of those guys, slashing .333/.376/.493 with 5 homers, 6 steals, and a 14.0/7.6 K%/BB% in 35 games at Triple-A. He struggled hard in the majors with a 50 wRC+, but a 20.0/8.1 K%/BB% with a 87.1 MPH EV isn’t that bad. The launch is low and the 27.5 ft/sec sprint is slightly above average, so we aren’t talking about a big talent here, but the guy can hit.

He profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher with 25 homers and a .267 BA in 25 games in the upper minors. The 18.6/11.1 K%/BB% shows the plate skills are also pretty good, making him relatively low risk. The risk comes from the fact that he isn’t a particularly good defensive catcher, so it’s possible the bat will have to hit well enough to profile at 1B/DH as well. He also has former first round Joe Mack and his 2024 breakout right behind him, so there is definitely going to be some competition for that job in the near future. – 2025 Projection: 31/8/36/.238/.309/.418/2 Prime Projection: 58/19/69/.251/.328/.439/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5555555555555556,0.8954248366013072,0.24183006535947713,0.7908496732026143,0.5555555555555556,59.19,,,,78.59922178988327,1,0.25,60.91439688715953,59.79353891050584,0.404,MLB,-4.1277778000000005,99.5333336,25.1,65.42256171315175,41.9,Power,48.0818194909183,26546,playerId

He jacked out 3 homers with a 91 MPH EV, 15% K% and 165 wRC+ in 40 PA. He might not be as good as his older brother, but the electric Acuna blood most certainly runs through his veins with a near elite 29.5 ft/sec sprint speed and a plus 73.5 MPH bat speed. He’s only 5’10”, and the 87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A wasn’t as impressive, but there is real juice in his bat, especially as he continues to get stronger. He’s a game changer on the bases with 40 steals at Triple-A, and he’s put up strong contact rates at every level, including the majors. He only had a 2.5% BB% in the majors, but he really didn’t chase a concerning amount with a 30.8% Chase%. The Mets are a wild card this off-season, so I hesitate to try to project their lineup right now, but he can play SS, 2B, and CF, which means he can basically play any position on the field, so that versality will keep his bat in the lineup if he’s producing. He looks like a mighty enticing dynasty asset right now. – 2025 Projection: 73/12/61/.256/.309/.394/23 Prime Projection: 84/16/69/.272/.328/.426/30",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1503267973856209,0.0457516339869281,0.2908496732026144,0.11764705882352941,0.803921568627451,23.9,,,,88.715953307393,1,0.25,68.75486381322956,39.59920233463035,0.712,MLB,-4.6333334000000015,100.0,32.8,40.0247607003891,34.2,Contact,39.44114231517509,26548,playerId

He doesn’t hit the ball hard with an 85.8 MPH EV at AAA and 0 Barrels in his 66 PA MLB debut, and at a small 5’10”, it’s hard to expect a lot more there. He’s also had contact issues his entire career with a 26% K% at AAA and a 25.8% K% in the majors. And lastly, he has a below average 70.7 MPH swing which is even worse from the left side with a 69.3 MPH swing (the side he swings with more often). He’s also not particularly great on defense. He has elite speed and base running ability, which makes him so fun for fantasy, but I think a bench OF is his most likely role. At only 22, maybe he can make improvements to the power, defense, and hit tool, which is why I don’t want to write him off completely, but I’m just not too excited by him anymore. – 2025 Projection: 25/3/21/.228/.292/.360/9 Prime Projection: 63/10/41/.249/.319/.391/24",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.27450980392156865,0.2875816993464052,0.2679738562091503,0.26143790849673204,0.24836601307189543,27.08,,,,23.73540856031129,1,0.25,18.394941634241246,24.040229571984437,1.0,MLB,-4.8305556,100.0,40.0,37.106068871595326,27.0,Contact,40.6477309922179,26599,playerId

The 91 MPH EV with a 18.4 degree launch backs up the breakout, but he was already 25 years old, and he was terrible in the majors with a 37 wRC+ and 35.5/3.4 K%/BB% in 27 games. He graded out as an above average defensive catcher, but he’s not as good as Jake Rogers, so the tie will go to Rogers if both of their offensive outputs are close. Dingler is going to have to outhit Rogers to take over the starting job, which is certainly possible, and he has the pop to be fantasy relevant if he does. – 2025 Projection: 27/8/34/.221/.279/.391/1",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.13725490196078433,0.7516339869281046,0.058823529411764705,0.477124183006536,0.6764705882352942,36.94,,,,46.69260700389105,1,0.25,36.186770428015556,36.676369649805444,0.176,MLB,-1.1472222999999993,63.76666759999999,19.4,40.88491103494164,47.6,Power,27.89154348572373,27464,playerId

San Diego dealt him with three other prospects and Zach Davies to get Yu Darvish and Victor Caratini from the Cubs that December. He has handled aggressive assignments with aplomb, powering High-A South Bend (2022) and Double-A Tennessee (2023) to championships before totaling 41 homers over the past two seasons as one of the youngest players in the Triple-A International League. He was the key prospect the Marlins acquired in the deal that sent Edward Cabrera to Chicago in January. Caissie has had no difficulty producing against much older competition, creating huge raw power with the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing and the still-growing strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame. He could provide 30 or more homers per season, with his pop playing from left-center to the right-field line and against both lefties and righties. He's an aggressive hitter with a naturally long stroke, leading to a 29 percent strikeout rate in his first four pro seasons, yet he's also a career .278 hitter with a 14 percent walk rate. Caissie is deceptively quick for his size, flashing plus speed at times and showing the ability to steal an occasional base. He has improved his reads and routes in the outfield and covers ground well enough to be at least an average defender. With his power and plus arm strength, he fits the right-field profile.

His 33.4% FB% is on the low side for a slugger, which is what is holding down the homer totals. It’s helping his BA, hitting .278, but with a 28.4% K% (which is a career best), he’s not going to hit for a high BA in the majors regardless. There could be a scenario where the strikeout rate is hovering around 30% in the majors with a launch that really isn’t all that high, which could result in some pretty mediocre numbers. I mainly bring this up because it’s the most interesting thing about projecting his future value, but when you pan out for the big picture, he’s a powerful and athletic 6’3”, 190 pounds with current plus power and possibly more coming down the line. He’ll also chip in with steals, nabbing 11 bags. And add two stars in OBP leagues with a 12.9% BB%. I don’t want to lose the forest through the trees by slicing and dicing the numbers too much, so I’m still projecting his as a low BA, high OBP slugger no matter how you slice it.

His next two years didn’t go as well, and he began the 2024 season repeating Double-A, but things clicked when he got to Triple-A; he continued to rake after the Pirates acquired him near the Trade Deadline for Quinn Priester. After a .918 OPS in 78 combined Triple-A games across two organizations, Yorke made his big league debut in mid-September. Yorke was able to rediscover his feel to hit last year, swinging and missing less often, doing more damage on pitches in the zone than he had in 2023 or even at the start of the ‘24 season. Much of that is because Yorke, often a tinkerer at the plate, got back to using the big part of the field after being too pull-oriented previously. He’s at his best when he drives the ball to the right side of the field, making him a much better hitter with two strikes, while understanding he is strong enough to pull mistake breaking stuff for home run power, though he can also hit the ball out the other way. It’s good that Yorke has reclaimed his stroke because the rest of his game is fringe-average, though his instincts help him steal some bags. His long-term defensive home is still up in the air. He’s played mostly second base in the Minors, although the Pirates gave him time at all three outfield spots following the trade and he got a game in at third in the big leagues. Second and a corner spot -- likely right field at PNC Park -- are probably the best options, and he could hit his way into the big league lineup soon.

He’s damn fast with a double plus 28.9 ft/sec sprint, he has a strong plate approach (24.4% Chase%), and he has a potentially above average to plus hit tool (.333 BA with a 18.9/12.2K%/BB% at AAA, plus a .290 xBA in the majors). I want to get really damn excited and tell you to target him everywhere, but there are a few things which I can’t just gloss over. He has a mostly line drive approach, so the game power isn’t huge right now, and he’s not a great base stealer, so he’s not going to rack up steals either. Really his biggest issue is that he isn’t a good defensive player. Nick Gonzales is the better defender and he had a relatively exciting year as well, so he’s the favorite for the job in the short term, and Termarr Johnson is the favorite to man 2B in the long run. That leaves Yorke as a utility type (he played 2B, OF, and 3B this year). Injuries happen and the cream generally rises to the top, so if Yorke hits, and I think he will, he is very likely to find plenty of at bats in 2025. Without being the favorite for a full time job, I wouldn’t be willing to really reach for him, but I will be hoping to scoop him up on the cheap everywhere I can. – 2025 Projection: 46/11/51/.252/.308/.403/10 Prime Projection: 81/18/73/.273/.334/.430/14",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3464052287581699,0.17647058823529413,0.3660130718954248,0.27450980392156865,0.4901960784313726,32.27,57.692307692307686,,,76.07003891050583,2,0.5,58.15075326748478,41.32826364361968,1.0,MLB,-4.6888888999999985,100.0,55.0,45.1469790930859,22.0,Contact,48.01614059188866,27504,playerId

There is very real fantasy upside in here too at 6’4”, 202 pounds with a plus power/speed combo. He also had a big time year at Double-A, slashing .280/.366/.476 with 18 homers, 30 steals, and a 27.5/11.7 K%/BB% in 126 games. He was 24 years old and the hit tool is a major issue, which is why he was available in the Rule 5, but if he can make enough hit tool gains in his mid to late 20’s, which we’ve seen plenty of toolsy prospects do in the past, he will get interesting in a hurry. He’s a lefty who was much better vs. righties than he was vs lefties, but I think that’s a good thing in this case, because it means he can end up a very fun strong side of a platoon player. And his 25.2% K% vs. righties was a tad better. I kinda like him in deeper leagues as a proximity play. – 2025 Projection: 17/5/19/.218/.289/.381/5 Prime Projection: 44/11/41/.231/.309/.413/15",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.75,0.9722222222222222,0.4583333333333333,0.9444444444444444,0.01388888888888884,66.43,,,,24.708171206225682,1,0.25,19.148832684824903,49.88159143968872,1.0,0–1 yr,-0.25,53.0,40.0,59.45097743190662,27.0,Power,41.30293984435799,27573,playerId

The problem is that he isn’t very good offensively. He hit .297 with 14 homers and a 17.8/4.3 K%/BB% in 85 games at Triple-A, which is good on the surface, but it only resulted in a 104 wRC+ to give you an idea of the offensive environment, and more importantly, the 85.2 MPH EV is very unimpressive. He then got a taste of the majors where he was atrocious in 53 PA. He put up a 9 wRC+ with an 82.2 MPH EV and 34.0%/3.8% K%/BB%. Hitting in Coors could make him useful in some of his peak years, but even Coors isn’t enough to save this profile. He’s going to have to hit the ball a lot harder to make a real impact. – 2025 Projection: 31/5/34/.232/.281/.358/1 Prime Projection: 50/13/57/.256/.309/.394/4",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.0915032679738562,0.24836601307189543,0.1895424836601307,0.21568627450980393,0.3431372549019608,19.64,,,,35.40856031128404,1,0.25,27.44163424124513,22.370571984435795,1.0,MLB,-4.0972222999999985,99.16666759999998,40.0,32.38817173533074,27.0,Contact,38.35801080089883,27763,playerId

His first signs of real struggle came when he got to Double-A in 2022 at age 20. A strong Arizona Fall League seemed to hit the reset button for him to head into 2023, but he’s had trouble staying healthy since. He played just 46 games in 2023 due to wrist surgery and while he performed a bit better in '24 (and reached Triple-A for the first time to earn a spot on the 40-man roster), thumb and back issues limited him to 65 games for the year. The 23-year-old outfielder still offers plenty of projection in his 6-foot-3 frame and game, if he can stay on the field. His 2023 wrist injury definitely wreaked some havoc with his swing mechanics, but it was encouraging that he started to get to some of his power again in '24, albeit sporadically. He’ll have to be cognizant of not trying to get to too much loft, something that has happened in the past, also the reason why his strikeout rate is north of 25 percent at the upper levels. Earlier in his career, he offered better bat-to-ball skills. A solid runner who squeezes every ounce of his speed by being aggressive with good instincts on the basepaths, Veen probably fits best in an outfield corner if he were to settle in as a regular. He’ll see time in all three outfield spots to provide options for when the need arises, but more than anything, he has to show that he can answer the bell over the course of a full, healthy season.

The book is far from written on him, but I think it’s more than fair to say he is one of my biggest misses in terms of ranking him as a near elite prospect a couple years ago. The development simply hasn’t happened like I thought it could, and him being a Rockies prospect, yea, maybe I should have seen that coming. But just because he hasn’t blown up, doesn’t mean he’s still not a pretty enticing fantasy prospect. As I expected, he bounced back from an injury induced down year in 2023, slashing .259/.346/.459 with 11 homers, 21 steals in 25 attempts, and a 24.8/11.1 K%/BB% in 65 games at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. We saw a power uptick that we were waiting for, but it was more of a moderate power uptick than a true explosion. And once again, his year was marred by injuries with a back and thumb injury, which once again sapped some power when he returned. I don’t know whether to think the constant injuries are hiding that upside that made me fall in love originally, or if he’s simply injury prone and it’s something that should be a demerit on his profile. Maybe a little of both. What makes him so exciting for fantasy is his speed and base running ability, which are at least plus, and he also has a good glove in the OF, which could get him on the field. The strikeout rates are elevated and the power looks like it might only end up average at best, so while I still see so much upside at a still projectable 6’3”, 190 pounds, I can’t rank him any higher than this. 2025 Projection: 29/6/26/.229/.292/.371/11 Prime Projection: 78/18/68/.248/.319/.418/25",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.28104575163398693,0.47058823529411764,0.43137254901960786,0.5359477124183006,0.522875816993464,42.04,62.96296296296296,0.0,80.43478260869566,84.04669260700389,4,1.0,57.22230054449645,47.35380519057375,1.0,MLB,-4.3833334000000015,100.0,85.0,52.328141557172124,12.0,Power+OBP,58.74766370072746,27770,playerId

He just doesn’t hit the ball hard enough (87.3 MPH at AAA and 85.7 MPH in the majors), or have good enough plate skills (see K/BB above), or run enough (9 steals) to be too enticing of a fantasy prospect. There also isn’t much defensive value, so it’s not like the glove will force him on the field. I’m not saying he can’t be a solid bat at peak, because I think he can be, I’m just not too enthused about rostering him until it maybe happens. – 2025 Projection: 25/5/29/.237/.293/.389/2 Prime Projection: 66/19/74/.259/.318/.420/8",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6666666666666666,0.22875816993464052,0.7647058823529411,0.41830065359477125,0.33333333333333337,51.63,,,,55.252918287937746,1,0.25,42.82101167315175,48.546854085603115,0.888,MLB,-4.713888900000001,100.0,37.2,57.96055622568094,29.8,OBP,49.05225030155643,27883,playerId

His value won’t tank but it won’t explode either.” … that is essentially exactly what happened with a .230 BA and 19.3/13.6 K%/BB% in 100 games. And his value actually tanked more than I thought it would, but I’m not sure it deserves to tank that hard. The .261 BABIP shows he was definitely on the unlucky side, and he still had 14 homers, 35 steals, and a 111 wRC+, so it was far from a disaster season. Colorado rushed him to the majors for 10 games in June because they are one of the weirdest franchises out there, but I would ignore those numbers. The 2B job is wide open for him, and while the power likely ends up below average, the hit, plate approach, and speed can certainly make a fantasy impact. – 2025 Projection: 28/5/26/.246/.305/.371/10 Prime Projection: 84/17/62/.273/.341/.426/27",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5686274509803921,0.40522875816993464,0.8823529411764706,0.5751633986928104,0.8954248366013072,64.5,,,,87.35408560311284,1,0.25,67.69941634241243,65.61979571984435,1.0,MLB,-5.713888900000001,100.0,40.0,70.16093871595331,27.0,OBP,55.52242242217899,27962,playerId

He’s had an excellent plate approach his entire professional career, putting up a 17.4/9.7 K%/BB% in 98 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. There is some juice in his bat too with 16 homers, but there isn’t huge raw power at 5’10” (87.3 MPH EV at Triple-A), and the launch isn’t very high either (7.2 degrees at Triple-A). It’s an above average hit/power combo in the minors which might play as an average hit/power combo in the majors, but at only 22 years old, you can give him a bump for age to level. He’s the type that has more value the deeper the league is, because I’m seeing more of a solid than standout hitting catcher. – 2025 Projection: 36/10/41/.246/.305/.391/1 Prime Projection: 66/17/72/.266/.339/.429/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.48366013071895425,0.032679738562091505,0.8888888888888888,0.17973856209150327,0.5947712418300654,44.85,,,,57.58754863813229,1,0.25,44.63035019455252,44.773122568093385,0.32,MLB,-5.699999999999999,100.0,23.0,53.09943677042802,44.0,OBP,41.89474654669261,28022,playerId

His 75.4 MPH swing is straight elite, which proves right there that his talent really wasn’t that overhyped as an international prospect. His 23.4% whiff% was comfortably above average, which is pretty huge to see, and his 28.1% Chase% was slightly above average. Tack on plus speed, and Dominguez’ beastly potential was even able to shine through despite the Yanks refusing to unleash him. And oh yea, he destroyed the upper minors immediately after returning from Tommy John surgery in mid May with a 135 wRC+, 11 homers, 16 steals (in 17 attempts) and a 20.0/8.8 K%/BB% in 58 games. Is he really 22 years old and not like 26 years old? Beats me. But I don’t care when it comes to a talent this huge (I gave my thoughts on MLB cracking down on players’ lying about their ages in the Philadelphia Phillies Dynasty Team Report). I see no reason why the Yanks won’t unleash him immediately in 2025, and he could be on a beeline for elite dynasty asset status in short order.

The pandemic delayed the elder Garcia's pro debut until 2021 and he struggled in his first two years in the United States before breaking out in 2024. After adding significant strength and bat speed during the offseason, he slashed .286/.356/.536 with 23 homers and 17 steals in 107 games while advancing from Single-A to Double-A and claiming a spot on Boston's 40-man roster. He hit 21 more homers between Double-A and Triple-A in '25 en route to making his big league debut in late August. He was sent to the Pirates in early December as part of the Johan Oviedo deal. Known as ""The Password"" because of his hard-to-spell first name, Garcia carries at least 50 pounds more than his listed weight of 163 and featured some of the best strength and raw power in the Red Sox system. His right-handed swing is designed to launch balls in the air, and he did so more often in 2024 while producing high-end exit velocities. He does damage against both lefties and righties and could produce 25-30 homers per season, though he may have to tone down his aggressive approach against more advanced pitching, something that led to an inflated 26.8 percent strikeout rate in the Minors in 2025. Garcia is deceptively athletic despite his added muscle, showing average speed out of the batter's box and a little more underway, and he'll look to steal and take extra bases. He spent most of the past two seasons in center field, where he's an average defender with good instincts. He's at least a solid defender on the corners and has the plus arm strength for right field.

He has legit thunder in his bat with a quick and powerful righty swing that resulted in 23 homers in 107 games. He hits the ball really hard and he lifts it with all fields power. He’s also a good athlete who can play CF, and he’ll run a bit too with 17 steals. He started the year at Single-A and flew all the way through to Double-A by mid August. He wasn’t quite as good at Double-A as he was in the lower minors, but he still put up an above average 103 wRC+, and the most important thing is that his K rate didn’t skyrocket with a 19% K%. The hit tool and plate approach are certainly the biggest risk here with a 21.6/7.2 K%/BB% overall, but the K rate actually got better at each higher level, and he walked a ton in 2021-23, so he has that skill in there. His combination of power, athleticism and good OF defense is very enticing, and the hit tool was actually pretty decent this year. Boston is crowded, so he doesn’t have a path to playing time, but trades happen and injuries/ineffectiveness happens too, so he’ll get his shot eventually, and when he does, we could be looking at a guy who puts up big EV’s with a high launch, above average sprint, positive defense value, and good enough K rates. He can be a legit impact fantasy bat going for a price way under that right now.

Mayo was utterly lost at the dish with a .294 OPS and 47.8/8.7 K%/BB% in 46 PA. He had zero barrels with an 84.7 MPH EV and a 45.6% whiff%. It’s a small sample, but I’ve seen a lot of poor debuts, and this one is up there with some of the worst, especially for a hyped up prospect. The debut was especially bad, but we’ve seen plenty of eventual studs have a terrible MLB debut. Just to use one example, Aaron Judge had a .179 BA with a 42.5% whiff% in his 95 PA debut (although it came with 4 homers and a .608 OPS), and he’s been just fine. I don’t want to put too much weight on the scary debut when Mayo has so many other things going him. His power is unquestionable at 6’5”, 230 pounds with 22 homers and a 90.7 MPH EV in 89 games at Triple-A. He swings a lightning quick bat with a double plus 74.1 MPH swing, and it’s a relatively short swing too with a 7 foot length. His strikeout rates were also so much better in the minors with a 24.9% K% this year. He was getting sporadic playing time in the majors and doing a lot of pinch hitting, which is another reason to mostly ignore the MLB numbers. Is it in the back of my mind? Yea, I’m human. But I’m still treating him like an elite power hitting prospect. He currently doesn’t have a starting job, so he’s going to need injuries/ineffectiveness to open one up for him, or he’s going to have to truly kick the door down. – 2025 Projection: 39/14/49/.225/.302/.435/3 Prime Projection: 84/33/98/.249/.336/.512/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.19607843137254902,0.5947712418300654,0.13071895424836602,0.32679738562091504,0.20261437908496727,28.73,,,,94.74708171206225,1,0.25,73.42898832684824,44.374645914396886,0.964,MLB,-4.3777778000000005,100.0,39.099999999999994,44.11389377431907,27.9,Power,43.48625219844358,28312,playerId

I don’t hate him, but it’s just not a profile that deserves to get ranked very highly right now. 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.228/.281/.398/0 Prime Projection: 66/24/71/.251/.318/.451/1",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2679738562091503,0.7189542483660131,0.3464052287581699,0.6862745098039216,0.7516339869281046,50.17,,,,55.83657587548638,1,0.25,43.27334630350194,47.75617120622568,1.0,MLB,-5.436111199999999,100.0,40.0,56.9203513618677,27.0,Power,49.564158112840474,28552,playerId

He had a nondescript debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2021 and performed better in the Arizona Complex League in 2022 before struggling with the full-time move to Single-A Inland Empire in 2023. He got off to a good start with High-A Tri-City, so the Angels moved him up to Double-A at age 20, when he once again scuffled. Since signing, Guzman has teased with some signs of raw power, but he’s never shown a consistent enough hit tool to get to it in games. His strikeout rate has climbed north of 27 percent for his last two seasons, though he has typically been one of the youngest performers at each level. He needs to cut down on the swing-and-miss in order to get a real idea of what kind of impact he can have from the right side of the plate. One thing that continues to trend upwards is Guzman’s defense. He’s really improved at shortstop with a plus arm, good hands and instincts, and the talk of him possibly outgrowing the position has died down. His glove work gives him a floor of getting to the big leagues as as defensive-minded utility type. He's playing at age 21 for all of the 2025 season, so there’s time for him to tap into that offensive upside the Angels were betting on when they signed him, and that could make him a regular at shortstop in the big leagues.

His advanced hitting ability has put his career on fast forward, as he reached full-season ball at age 18 and Triple-A at 20. He slashed .289/.354/.471 with 19 homers in 124 games between Double-A and Triple-A in 2024, winning Chicago's Minor League Player of the Year Award for the second straight season. Ballesteros has a pretty left-handed swing and some of the best bat-to-ball skills in the Minors. His lone weakness at the plate is a tendency to chase pitches out of the zone, especially fastballs, which has cut into his walk totals at higher levels and resulted in less contact in Triple-A. He has done a better job of driving balls in the air the last two seasons, showing improved power to all fields and giving him 20-25 homer upside. Much heavier than his listed 195 pounds, Ballesteros has well-below-average speed and quickness, giving him no value on the bases and leading to questions about his long-term viability as a catcher. In 72 games behind the plate last year, he committed seven errors and 13 passed balls while surrendering 87 steals in 99 attempts (88 percent). He does feature soft hands, which along with his hitting ability earns him some Alejandro Kirk comparisons, and he’ll flash solid arm strength that plays down because of his slow footwork and transfer. First base is his only other realistic position, but no big leaguer 5-foot-8 or shorter has played 100 games in a season there since Joe Judge in 1930.

He’s only 21 years old, so maybe he’ll improve, and maybe Chicago will be fine with his below average defense because they are not strong at catcher in both the majors and the minors. Even if Ballesteros moves off catcher to 1B/DH, he definitely has the bat to clear that high bar. He possesses one of the best hit/power combos in the minors, slashing .289/.354/.471 with 19 homers, 1 steal, and a 18.3/8.9 K%/BB% in 124 games split between Double-A (154 wRC+) and Triple-A (106 wRC+). And keep in mind he did that as a 20 year old. He started to lift and pull the ball more at Triple-A, which spiked his K rate a bit, but we’ll take that tradeoff for more dingers. Lack of defensive value can certainly end up a real issue if his bat ends up more above average than great, but Chicago has every incentive for him to stick behind the plate, so I’m leaning he gets a real shot there. – 2025 Projection: 33/9/39/.258/.307/.420/1 Prime Projection: 73/24/84/.275/.332/.450/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6405228758169934,0.38562091503267976,0.7124183006535948,0.6339869281045751,0.8758169934640523,63.0,100.0,81.25,,87.7431906614786,3,0.75,82.73049467841611,69.90567313744563,1.0,MLB,-6.2888889,100.0,70.0,70.6217019412337,17.0,OBP,63.229765873555166,28820,playerId

Basallo was one of the club’s first big signs, getting a then-organizational record bonus of $1.3 million in January 2021. Since then, he’s climbed the ladder relatively quickly, spending nearly all of the 2024 season at age 19 at the upper levels of the Orioles system and representing the organization in the Futures Game. While Basallo’s overall surface numbers weren’t as eye-popping last year as they were the year prior, struggling a bit in a small sample in his first taste of Triple-A, he still projects to be a very productive left-handed hitter. He hits the ball hard as consistently as anyone in the system and even had good exit velocities despite his tribulations with Norfolk. With strong hands and a simple setup, Basallo has a good approach at the plate, limiting strikeouts and drawing walks. He can get over-aggressive at times because of his knack for making contact, leading to higher chase rates, but he’s shown the ability to drive the ball with considerable power to all fields. Basallo’s defensive game isn’t considered nearly as sure of a thing as his bat. He has a cannon for an arm that can help control the running game and he moves surprisingly well behind the dish for a 6-foot-4 backstop. Scouts like his hands and think that gives him a shot to stick, though his overall receiving and blocking continue to be a work in progress. Believers think he’ll work out the rough edges given his age while others think he could end up at first base, where his bat should still play.

He was also much better at Double-A with a 134 wRC+ in 106 games than he was at Triple-A (62 wRC+ with a 31.4% K% in 21 games), so I think we can give him a pass for an adjustment period with a new team, coaches, teammates, league, home park etc … Even at Triple-A, the sweet lefty swinging, 6’4” Basallo put up a 91.1 MPH EV. He’s always put up solid contact rates in the minors, but the spike at Triple-A could also be an indicator that we shouldn’t expect the highest BA at least early in his career. He puts the ball on the ground a decent amount, but with his type of double plus power, he’s launch proof. I don’t know where he fits in defensively with Adley behind the plate, and plenty of competition at 1B (Mayo and Mountcastle), but long term there seems to be plenty of room for all of them. He’s a special power bat. – 2025 Projection: 28/9/35/.241/.300/.430/2 Prime Projection: 84/30/97/.268/.337/.505/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.869281045751634,0.934640522875817,0.5228758169934641,0.9281045751633987,0.326797385620915,74.46,100.0,100.0,,97.66536964980544,3,0.75,91.61078049897002,80.4627731746395,1.0,MLB,-7.052777800000001,100.0,70.0,80.09183195239186,17.0,Power+OBP,67.49132437857634,28824,playerId

The catcher was young for both the Single-A and High-A stops in 2022 and 2023 respectively and repeated Quad Cities last season with impressive results (.271/.386/.435, 10 homers, 16 steals in 84 games). He was promoted to Double-A Northwest Arkansas in July, posted a 112 wRC+ over 170 plate appearances there and was rewarded with another challenge in the Arizona Fall League to round out his third full season. Jensen finished with 18 homers in 125 games during the 2024 Minor League season -- a healthy jump from his totals of 11 in both 2022 and 2023 -- and four more across 12 Fall League games. A high-walk, solid-OBP performer earlier in his career, the left-handed slugger meaningfully worked on being less passive at the plate early in counts and attacking drivable pitches. That got his pop to play more and continued physical maturation has helped that further. He’s still only entering his age-21 season and could find a happy medium as a backstop who gets on base and provides value with his power too. Jensen is a below-average runner (no surprise for his position) who used his baserunning knowledge to swipe bags in High-A but reeled that in at Double-A. Kansas City has managed his workload well over his three full seasons, enabling him to stay healthy but also pick up enough reps to become at least an average framer behind the dish. His above-average arm strength and improved actions give baserunners something to think about and round out a solid all-around profile.

He put up a 137 wRC+ in 84 games at High-A, and then he got the call to Double-A where he put up a 112 wRC+ with 8 homers in 41 games. He obliterated the AFL too with a silly 1.382 OPS and 4 homers in 12 games, but granted, I think I could have put up a 1.000+ OPS against AFL pitching this year. He hits the ball very hard, he has no groundball issues, and he can pull it. He’s a legit exciting power bat with a howitzer lefty swing, but it comes with legit hit tool risk too. He hit .233 with a 26.5/8.8 K%/BB% when he got to Double-A, and he has a career .235 BA in 373 minor league games. He walks a ton, so add a star in OBP leagues, but the hit tool still needs to take a step forward to be a slam dunk starting MLB catcher. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/22/68/.232/.317/.435/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7712418300653595,0.6862745098039216,0.5620915032679739,0.6797385620915033,0.30718954248366015,63.43,100.0,84.61538461538461,100.0,53.11284046692607,4,1.0,79.74334031727028,69.1396691110446,1.0,MLB,-5.941666699999999,100.0,85.0,70.62840073331338,12.0,Power+OBP,66.98278032999103,29478,playerId

The main selling point is the stolen base upside with him stealing 50 bags in 93 bags at Triple-A. But what makes him so exciting, is that he is not just a light hitting speedster. He can actually hit the ball pretty damn hard, and he showed that in his MLB debut with a 88.5/98.2 MPH AVG/FB EV. The EV was strong at Triple-A too with an 88.8 MPH EV. He’s not a huge lift and pull guy, but he can lift and pull enough to rip some dingers (12 in 93 games at AAA), and especially in Seattle’s ballpark, we don’t want him to lift and pull. Hitting the ball hard all over the field works perfectly for his profile. He’s also a good 2B. The biggest issue is that the hit tool is not quite optimal for this type of profile. He put up a 22.4% K% at AAA and a 31% K% in the majors. The plate approach is good with a 14.1% BB% at AAA and an excellent 21% Chase% in the majors, which mitigates the hit tool somewhat, but not all the way. That is the thing holding me back from going too crazy, but Bliss could be free to very cheap in most leagues, and why not take a shot. – 2025 Projection: 61/13/52/.237/.304/.380/23 Prime Projection: 77/17/66/.254/.325/.416/31",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6928104575163399,0.45098039215686275,0.6339869281045751,0.7287581699346405,0.24183006535947715,57.27,,,,77.431906614786,1,0.25,60.009727626459146,58.2289046692607,0.232,MLB,-2.3861111999999984,78.63333439999998,20.8,60.762171560778214,46.2,Power+OBP,40.29964408235019,29547,playerId

His bat is really going to have to max out, and the good news is that it maxed out in 2024. He utterly obliterated Triple-A with a 144 wRC+, 26 homers, and a 16.9/11.6 K%/BB% in 105 games, and then he utterly obliterated the majors with a 146 wRC+, 4 homers, and a 32.2/8.0 K%/BB% in 25 games. As you can see from that K/BB though, the hit tool is a major risk, and his strikeout rates in the minors prior to this season were very high. The power is plus and he puts the ball in the air, but the hit tool risk combined with the poor defense could be enough to keep him as a bench bat. He’s highly unlikely to take the starting catcher job away from Gabriel Moreno anyway, even if he was better on defense. In most leagues, he’s probably someone you jump on when/if he does get in the lineup, rather than someone you hold waiting for it. – 2025 Projection: 41/10/47/.245/.312/.423/1",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5947712418300654,0.8823529411764706,0.5163398692810458,0.8300653594771242,0.05882352941176472,60.17,,,,53.30739299610895,1,0.25,41.31322957198444,53.57013035019455,0.62,MLB,-2.1750000000000007,76.10000000000001,30.5,60.579539105058366,36.5,Power+OBP,43.10579259727627,29554,playerId

He’s 6’3”, 212 pounds with a 74.1 MPH swing which is in double plus territory. It resulted in a 91.1 MPH EV with a 12.8 degree launch. His 28.1 ft/sec sprint speed is above average to plus, stealing 16 bags in 96 games at Triple-A and 3 bags in 43 games in the majors (including the playoffs). He was also a plus defender at SS. This is a pretty special athlete here. His .642 OPS in 36 games isn’t super impressive, he didn’t exactly dominate Triple-A with a 88 wRC+, and there is hit tool risk with a 32.4% whiff%. But all of those are more than baked into his price, overly so in my opinion. My attention is on the things he does well, and that makes him a very enticing target relative to his perceived value. – 2025 Projection: 71/18/76/.237/.308/.416/11 Prime Projection: 83/22/78/.252/.328/.444/14",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4444444444444444,0.24183006535947713,0.5522875816993464,0.2549019607843137,0.369281045751634,38.92,,,,85.60311284046693,1,0.25,66.34241245136187,48.51784435797666,0.432,MLB,-2.75,83.0,25.8,48.411353307393,41.2,OBP,37.36510898832685,29575,playerId

He put up a 125 wRC+ in his 24 game MLB debut, but it came with 2 homers and 0 steals. He swings a slow bat (68.9 MPH), he’s slow himself (26.4 ft/sec sprint), and he doesn’t hit the ball all that hard (88.1 MPH EV with a 4.4% Barrel% at Triple-A). He had a 90.6 MPH EV with a 9.1% Barrel% in the majors, but the AAA numbers were the bigger sample. The hit tool and approach are the calling card (10.4/16.6 K%/BB% at Triple-A and a 18.6% K% and .305 BA in the majors), but as you guys already know well, this isn’t my type of player. He’s a fine 2B, so it’s not like his glove is really going to force the issue either. He’s a bench infielder long term, and even if he does get a full time job, the upside isn’t worth it. – 2025 Projection: 35/6/35/.275/.323/.407/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3137254901960784,0.33986928104575165,0.3333333333333333,0.37254901960784315,0.9084967320261438,40.88,,,,34.24124513618677,1,0.25,26.53696498054474,35.85993774319066,0.88,MLB,-1.0138889000000013,62.166666800000016,37.0,42.566981342957206,30.0,Contact,34.48847496433075,29634,playerId

He might have to get used to that, because it seems like he’s setting up for a Bryan Reynolds-like fantasy career. Really good, but not good enough for anyone to seemingly care to really gush over him. That 142 wRC+ came with only 8 homers and 13 steals in 77 games. He did it on the back of the hit tool with a .307 BA and 19.7/9.0 K%/BB%, but the .367 BABIP did some of that heavy lifting, and his strikeout rates have been on the high side throughout his career, so you can’t really bank on a truly elite hit tool long term. His sweet lefty swing at 6’3” is what got him drafted so highly, and that swing is still special with power and quickness, but it’s geared more for all around hitting than pure homer power with a 47.4% GB% and 26.5% FB%. He’s a good baserunner, but he’s not a burner, so you can’t count on huge steal totals either. Reynolds is really the perfect comp with his 162 game career averages of a .276 BA, .352 OBP, 25 homers and 8 steals. Maybe playing with Boston instead of Pittsburgh will garner him more hype in the long run, but fantasy wise, that equals a really good fantasy player who never quite reaches great levels. 2025 Projection: 28/8/33/.256/.318/.415/6 Prime Projection: 91/25/93/.276/.352/.470/11",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6209150326797386,0.6274509803921569,0.5098039215686274,0.6241830065359477,0.5686274509803921,59.15,,,,95.33073929961088,1,0.25,73.88132295719842,64.30596303501945,0.948,MLB,-5.3833334000000015,100.0,38.7,66.82428891050583,28.3,Power+OBP,53.56593000972762,29668,playerId

I’ve talked about this in a previous year’s Strategy Section, but it’s easy to assume every down year for a prospect is him regressing as a player, and every monster year is a true breakout, rather than it sometimes just being a down year or a career year. So even though I was a bit lower than most last year on Montgomery, writing, “Those are the reasons that make me hesitant to rank him as high as I see him in other places, but there is no denying he is a damn good prospect no matter how you slice it,” I’m still not going to jump ship. His profile remains the same for me as a 6’3”, 225 pound slugger with a clear path to playing time. He also came into the AFL fired up to wash the slate clean with 3 homers, a 6/10 K/BB, and a 1.167 OPS in 11 games, which shows everything you liked about him last off-season is still in here.

Considering he was the 25th overall pick in the 2021 Draft, he’s been flying super low under the radar despite strong minor league results throughout his career, especially when you consider age to level. Oakland has been relatively aggressive with him, and he’s responded to the challenge every single time, culminating with him putting up a 117 wRC+ in 50 games at Triple-A in his age 21 year old season this year. He doesn’t have a standout area in his game, which is likely why the hype has been so quiet, but he’s just a good all around player with 8 homers, 4 steals, and a 24.6/8.9 K%/BB%. He has about average power right now which should only tick up in the next few years, he’s a very good athlete who should contribute in steals, and he’s known as a good defensive SS, so his glove should help him get on the field The strikeout rates have been high throughout his career and there is definitely hit tool risk, so that combined with the fact he doesn’t really have standout power or speed makes me hesitant to go higher than this. He still feels underrated to me though. – 2024 Projection: 36/9/43/.226/.289/.392/7 Prime Projection: 72/20/77/.248/.321/.435/12",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.49673202614379086,0.3660130718954248,0.7712418300653595,0.6143790849673203,0.4444444444444444,53.69,,,,76.84824902723734,1,0.25,59.55739299610894,55.743587548638125,0.752,MLB,-5.086111200000001,100.0,33.8,61.25257626459144,33.2,OBP,49.34365931906615,29779,playerId

They both had extremely similar profiles. They are the same age, they are almost the same size, they are both excellent athletes with plus power/speed combos, they are both Oakland prospects, they are both outfielders, and they both had major swing and miss problems with strikeout rates north of 30% at High-A. But that is where their paths started to split, as Butler made extreme improvements to his strikeout rate, putting up a sub 20% K% in the upper minors in 2023 and 2024 (and obviously holding enough of those gains in the majors), while Clarke’s strikeout rate remained in the 30%+ area … that is until the 2nd half of this season. From June 12th on, Clarke slashed .317/.387/.524 with 9 homers, 30 steals and a 23.5/8.6 K%/BB% in 73 games at Double-A. Granted, he did it two years after Butler, so age to level isn’t as impressive, and he also had to lower his launch to do it with a 50.5% GB%, but that is still a major improvement to see, because like Butler, he has the type of power/speed combo to make a major fantasy impact. Even with the lower launch, he has the power and speed to make that type of profile work. I’ve been heavily debating Colby Thomas vs. Clarke, and while I gave the nod to Thomas because I trust his hit tool and launch more, I think Clarke has the upside nod.

He worked around a scapula fracture and broken left thumb in 2022 and produced a .930 OPS with 18 homers and 55 steals in 123 games while reaching Triple-A in 2023. He made his Major League debut on April 30, 2024 and played sporadically for Milwaukee throughout the summer but never caught on, despite solid Triple-A numbers (.258/.374/.429, 14 homers, 20 steals). Milwaukee announced on March 28 that a broken hamate would keep him out for the first six-to-eight weeks of the season. A left-handed hitter, the Ontario native continues to thrive most with his approach with solid chase and in-zone contact rates. He didn’t miss much against breaking pitches during his time at Triple-A either, though changeups proved to be a problem in The Show. Some evaluators believed he was too choosy around the edges of the zone in the Majors and could benefit from being more willing to swing on close calls. Black utilizes a big leg kick to stay in rhythm, and that helps him pull and lift the ball, leading to potential 12-15 homer outcomes in the Majors despite below-average exit velocities. Entering his age-24 season, Black remains a plus runner, and he should be a threat to steal 30-plus bags over a full season in the bigs. He’s seen time all over the dirt and grass in the pros but hasn’t truly stuck anywhere, and he still needs work at the cold corner, where he isn’t a natural fit with his size. Still, his overall approach and speed give him offensive upside, and he could be a left-handed complement to Rhys Hoskins or even compete for the full-time first-base job in ’25.

He spent the majority of his time at 1B and DH. And the bottom line is that low EV 1B/DH don’t really exist, especially ones who have a good but not great hit tool. He put up an 83 MPH EV with 0 barrels, a .561 OPS and a 29.8% K% in his 57 PA MLB debut. The EV sat at 85.7 MPH at Triple-A. He also doesn’t have the type of extreme lift and pull profile to really pull that off, but it doesn’t go in the extreme the other way either, so he can definitely pop some dingers. If he had a viable position, I wouldn’t mind the speed, OBP, good BA, some pop profile at all, but he doesn’t have a position, and I don’t think the upside is high enough to really wait to find out if he can find one. – 2025 Projection: 33/5/24/.245/.306/.383/9 Prime Projection: 77/13/61/.263/.332/.415/24",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.43790849673202614,0.23529411764705882,0.6405228758169934,0.20261437908496732,0.46405228758169936,41.07,10.71428571428571,,,50.583657587548636,2,0.5,28.87570641096905,36.80199724383917,1.0,MLB,-3.005555600000001,86.06666720000001,55.0,46.539099253151754,22.0,OBP,45.855928103918295,29949,playerId

The Georgia prep product has moved a level at a time over his four full seasons of pro ball, going to three Futures Games (in '23, '24 and '25) and starring for Great Britain in international competition, including the World Baseball Classic. He made a late-season, limited debut with the M’s in 2025 before being sent to the Nationals in the offseason in a trade for left-handed reliever Jose A. Ferrer. Playing as one of the younger players at every level, Ford has yet to put it all together in terms of statistical performance, but the right-handed hitter has shown some traits that point to plenty of future success. His 265 combined walks in his three full seasons place him second among all Minor Leaguers in that time span and he had a career .404 on base percentage heading into '25. Now using a simplified toe tap at the plate to help his timing, he has shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields. There’s loft in his swing, which translated to a career-high 16 home runs this year in the hitter-friendly Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Ford offers a unique profile as a catcher with plus speed, one who stole 35 bases in '24 and 82 bags over three years, giving him 20-20 potential. He still has work to do with his overall defensive work in terms of blocking and framing, but he has strong leadership skills, works hard at his craft and his agility plays well behind the dish. For the first time, he did see time in left field last year as the Mariners worked to add some positional flexibility to his resume.

It’s not a hard and fast line, but if you don’t have the power breakout in your age 21 year old season, I start to dock some points on a prospect’s future power potential. Even without hitting the ball hard, he still had a very strong season with a 119 wRC+, 35 steals, and a 22.0/14.1 K%/BB% at Double-A. He definitely has more raw juice in his bat than he’s shown, so even though I do have his value sliding, it’s not like I think a future power breakout can’t happen, and if it does, the speed, lift, pull, and plate approach will be there waiting for it. It’s uncertain if he can stick at catcher with Seattle playing him in the OF some, but due to his speed, he has the fantasy upside to profile there. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 76/18/68/.248/.333/.411/21",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7516339869281046,0.477124183006536,0.9019607843137255,0.5816993464052288,0.6405228758169934,68.78,94.44444444444444,,0.0,76.45914396887159,3,0.75,62.12523418359993,66.45083196425998,1.0,MLB,-5.574999999999999,100.0,70.0,72.764249589278,17.0,Power+OBP,64.1939123151751,29958,playerId

He’s no stranger to injuries as he also underwent major shoulder surgery in 2021. Out of sight, out of mind never loses in the prospecting industry, but Lawlar is the type of talent where you should fight that urge. He already had a huge year in the upper minors in 2023, and he’s only 22, so I don’t think lost development time should be a major consideration here. Even in the 23 games he played this year he put up .900 OPS, and he then got sent to the grown man Dominican Winter League and isn’t embarrassing himself with a .670 OPS. Only Hector Rodriguez of the Reds has a higher OPS of players around Lawlar’s age (he’s outdoing Noelvi Marte, Deyvison De Los Santos, and Liover Peguero). Just the fact he’s playing and getting reps in a league where everyone doesn’t put up silly numbers like the AFL is another reason to not get too hung up on the lost season. He has the potential for a special power/speed combo (20 homers and 36 steals in 105 games in 2023), and while there is some hit tool risk, it’s not really in that extreme zone with around mid 20 strikeout rates throughout his career. He’s not a finished product, and I would expect him to start the year in the minors, but Lawlar will be up eventually in 2025, and he can make a big impact immediately. Don’t ding him too much for the injuries. 2025 Projection: 55/14/57/.241/.312/.417/21 Prime Projection: 94/24/86/.266/.339/.459/38",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7581699346405228,0.8431372549019608,0.8235294117647058,0.9150326797385621,0.4281045751633987,76.87,,,,97.85992217898833,1,0.25,75.84143968871595,76.51000389105059,1.0,MLB,-4.980555599999999,100.0,40.0,80.23150116731519,27.0,Power+OBP,60.05417552529184,29976,playerId

His power did take a step forward this year with 19 homers, and he’s still a relatively svelte 6’4”, so I think there is more power coming when he gets into his man muscles years. Keep in mind he was just 21 years old in the upper minors, while hyped, similarly aged college bats were struggling or not exactly dominating in the lower minors. He needs to improve his hit tool and plate approach, which is why he isn’t ranked higher on this list, but he still looks on track to be that middle of the order power bat we thought he could be.

HS as the 28th overall pick in the 2021 Draft and didn’t need long to put his stamp on pro ball with 19 homers and 28 steals as a Carolina League All-Star for Single-A Charleston a year later. He’s been a power-speed threat ever since and was named the top prospect in the Southern League in 2024 after slashing .256/.352/.469 with 20 homers and 33 steals in 115 games for Double-A Montgomery. On four of the five major tools alone, Williams could be a future All-Star shortstop. A Minor League Gold Glove winner, he earns praise from across the industry for his glovework at a premium position. Evaluators point out that his quickness helps him get to balls deep in the hole and his high-quality hands make sure he completes the play. He has plus-plus arm strength dating back to his days as a prep pitcher and the accuracy to go along with it. What’s more, he is strong for his size at 6-foot-2 and utilizes that with a simple setup and violent swing that gets the ball in the air. The right-handed slugger struck out 28.5 percent of the time at Double-A last season. That’s normally a concern, but it was also down from the low 30s earlier in his career. The high K rate speaks more to pitch selection than anything mechanical; Williams tends to stay in the zone but will miss more on breaking stuff -- a trend that's held into Triple-A in 2025. A better understanding of swinging at more drivable pitches will keep that strikeout trend moving in the right direction and allow Williams’ plus power to play even more. But as always, his defense alone gives him a great floor as he closes in on the Majors.

It actually improved at Double-A with a 28.5% K%, and that was good enough to let his special talent shine. He jacked 20 homers with 33 steals, a 11.5% BB% and a 142 wRC+ in 115 games. He’s a still projectable 6’2”, 180 pounds with an explosive righty swing that is made to launch homers. He’s also an excellent athlete with plus speed and plus SS defense. Tampa’s long term SS job is literally waiting for him (the Kim signing could impact Williams’ projected playing time for 2025, but it’s better for his long term development anyway to take it slow), and because of his plus defense, he is sure to have all the leash he can handle even if it takes his hit tool a year or two to adjust to MLB pitching. If he can keep the K% in the high 20’s, he will be a beast, and if he can continue to improve on it at only 21 years old, there is near elite dynasty asset upside. – 2025 Projection: 21/7/29/.230/.300/.424/9 Prime Projection: 89/28/96/.254/.334/.483/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2875816993464052,0.7908496732026143,0.21568627450980393,0.43790849673202614,0.02614379084967322,36.8,100.0,83.33333333333334,,98.83268482490273,3,0.75,87.52107652399482,54.55237678339819,1.0,MLB,-5.919444500000001,100.0,70.0,51.605713035019456,17.0,Power,54.67257086575876,30038,playerId

He’s once again blocked after the Tyler O’Neill signing. It seems obvious they want to use him as trade bait, but I guess nobody has bitten so far (that could change as they are still on the hunt for pitching). It’s a shame, because he’s clearly overdo for his shot. He smoked Triple-A with 16 homers, a 26.0/12.4 K%/BB%, and a 152 wRC+ in 56 games. It came with a 90.7 MPH EV and 16.8 degree launch. And then he was really good in the majors with 4 homers, a 116 wRC+ and 90.2 MPH EV in 114 PA. The swing and miss was on the high side with a 31.3% whiff% and 28.9% K%, but neither of those are too bad, and he also chased a lot with a 35% Chase%, so he needs to refine the plate skills, but that is to be expected with such little MLB experience. He’s not a great defensive player, so he’s definitely going to have to rake to hold down a job, but if he doesn’t rake, it doesn’t matter for us anyway. I love betting on the pedigree (2nd overall pick in the draft), history of production, and hard hit ability, but without opportunity, none of it matters. – 2025 Projection: 41/15/47/.250/.328/.440/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.026143790849673203,0.13725490196078433,0.032679738562091505,0.0392156862745098,0.2287581699346405,8.01,,,,90.46692607003891,1,0.25,70.11186770428014,29.745653696498046,0.656,MLB,-1.5500000000000007,68.60000000000001,31.400000000000002,23.619196108949414,35.6,Contact,25.28863824902724,31166,playerId

The Cardinals selected him in the fourth round that summer and he became a Midwest League end-of-season All-Star after his first full campaign in 2023. Even with that accolade, Crooks enjoyed his biggest breakout yet last season when he was named Texas League MVP after slashing .321/.410/.498 with 11 homers in 90 games. His 156 wRC+ was fourth-best among 125 catchers with at least 300 plate appearances in the Minors. A left-handed hitter, Crooks has a wide stance that takes up nearly the entire batter’s box. With his hands held out a little below his shoulders, he can look like he’s rocking back and forth before swinging his lead leg over to generate momentum. He simply doesn’t miss many fastballs, often meeting the ball on a line and shooting it back from whence it came. His overall impact numbers were solid for the Texas League, and his ability to drive hard liners around the diamond will help his power. A flatter swing has led to some issues with breaking stuff that drags down the offensive profile a bit. Crooks has shown consistent gains with framing and receiving since his college days. He looks like he'll be at least above-average defender in the end, and he gives baserunners plenty to think about with an efficient throwing motion behind the plate. The Cardinals may still be searching for a long-term catcher with Willson Contreras’ move to first, and as a glove-first backstop who can provide left-handed pop, Crooks could be a viable option soon.

His strong glove gives him a leg up as many of the catchers on this list are iffy to stick at the position, and it’s not like he’s chopped liver on offense either. He just handled his business at Double-A with a 156 wRC+, 11 homers, and a 21.0/11.6 K%/BB% in 90 games. He has a good feel to hit, a good approach, and he can hit it hard at 6’0”, 230 pounds.

Will Smith is signed until 2034, meaning Rushing looks ticketed for some kind of hybrid C/1B/OF/DH role, and with how hard it is to crack the Dodgers full time lineup (and with how little leash they give their prospects due to unlimited resources and strong organizational depth), it seems like Rushing is going to have to scratch and claw for playing time. They are not rolling out the red carpet for him at all, and I do think it hurts his fantasy value a bit. Putting defense aside for now, as a pure hitter, there is so much to like. He proved himself in the upper minors in 2024, slashing .271/.385/.512 with 26 homers, 2 steals, and a 20.5/12.7 K%/BB% in 114 games split between Double-A (149 wRC+) and Triple-A (128 wRC+). He has easy plus power with a 90.8 MPH EV, he has a launch made for both power and average, and he has a plus plate approach. The hit tool is solid, but I can see that dipping to below average against major league pitching, and like I mentioned earlier, we have seen LA be very quick with the hook if young players aren’t producing. I like the bat a ton, but defense, path to playing time, and the slight hit tool questions are enough to make me hesitant to really value him at a premium right now. – 2025 Projection: 38/12/45/.242/.310/.428/1 Prime Projection: 78/24/83/.262/.339/.465/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8888888888888888,0.6013071895424836,0.9477124183006536,0.7287581699346405,0.5490196078431373,77.36,,,,92.21789883268482,1,0.25,71.46887159533073,75.29810505836575,0.68,MLB,-3.5749999999999993,92.89999999999999,32.0,79.07243151750973,35.0,Power+OBP,55.31259418287937,31382,playerId

It’s a small sample, and you have to give him time to adjust to the highest level, but it’s really not what you want to see. He’s not the type of prospect that is just going to be handed a job, so he’s going to have to start hitting pretty quickly if he wants to lock in a full time role anytime soon. He’s also in a terrible hitter’s park, which will subdue his offensive stats to begin with. He has plus power with 16 homers in 111 games in the upper minors, and he even had an above average 8% Barrel% in the majors, so he can certainly make an impact, but the power isn’t really off the charts. Combined with the ballpark and hit tool issues, the reasonable ceiling here is likely more of a solid fantasy bat than a great one, and that is assuming he can win a job eventually. Seattle currently has opportunity at both 1B and DH, so he could earn that opportunity in 2025. – 2025 Projection: 35/11/42/.230/.302/.402/2 Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.251/.332/.448/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7777777777777778,0.7712418300653595,0.7908496732026143,0.8366013071895425,0.4836601307189542,74.86,,,,73.73540856031128,1,0.25,57.14494163424124,68.65972957198443,1.0,MLB,-3.333333400000001,90.00000080000001,40.0,75.27091899159532,27.0,Power+OBP,55.8219137062179,31396,playerId

He hit 0 homers with 0 steals, an 86.4 MPH EV, a 26 ft/sec sprint speed, and a 30.9% K%. It’s not that I don’t think he can be a solid MLB hitter, and his 102 wRC+ and 16% BB% shows very clearly that he can be a solid MLB hitter, it’s just that there isn’t big fantasy upside. He doesn’t hit the ball hard, he’s slow, and the hit tool is below average. He can lift and pull it, but both his lift and pull plummeted in the majors, and while that should improve, it’s not the best sign. He’s also a bad defensive player and he put up a .649 OPS vs. lefties in the minors. His best skill is that he walks a lot, so add a star in OBP leagues, but in general, Jung is not one of my guys. – 2025 Projection: 42/10/35/.238/.318/.402/2 Prime Projection: 82/20/76/.254/.343/.440/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5424836601307189,0.5555555555555556,0.45098039215686275,0.38562091503267976,0.27450980392156865,47.0,,,,70.62256809338521,1,0.25,54.73249027237353,49.70637159533074,1.0,MLB,-3.1944444999999995,88.333334,40.0,54.011911578599225,27.0,Power+OBP,45.92202701036966,31437,playerId

They used it to take Stewart, a multi-sport standout from the Miami high school ranks, because they liked his bat, approach and competitiveness. He’s pretty much been as advertised, hitting his way across two levels of A-ball in 2023, then performing well back in High-A in his second full season, though a wrist injury limited him to just 80 games. Stewart’s advanced approach has been apparent from day one of his pro career. He carried a miniscule 15.7 percent career strikeout rate into the 2025 season and he’s walked as often as he’s struck out (138 BB vs. 139 Ks). He makes a lot of hard contact and can send line drives to all fields consistently against all kinds of pitching. Just 21 for all of this season, he’s still learning to tap into his considerable raw power, with confidence it will come without him losing any of his hitability. A solid basketball player as a prepster, Stewart is more athletic and agile than people give him credit for. His below-average speed does limit him a bit, but he stayed in good shape and split his time almost evenly between second and third base with Dayton last year. His bat is his carrying tool and he has a clean bill of health for the '25 season, with the Reds likely to maintain his positional flexibility so they can get it into the big league lineup when he’s ready.

He put up a 16.9/14.8 K%/BB% in 80 games at High-A which led to a 144 wRC+. It’s basically the same thing he did in 2023 and 2022. But he’s not just a plus plate approach, he also has very real raw power. Just watch him crush this dinger 454 feet out to centerfield . This is a big physical guy in the box who can certainly unleash more game power if he tries. He hit only 8 homers this year and he likes to spray liners all over the field, so he would definitely have to change his hitting approach to do it, which may or may not work. He might just be content to plate approach his way through the minors. I don’t love betting on plate approach guys who don’t have much speed and aren’t particularly good defensive players, but if he does unlock more game power, he could end up having a very potent hit/power combo at peak. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 84/21/76/.274/.350/.452/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9019607843137255,0.7581699346405228,0.673202614379085,0.8169934640522876,0.7777777777777778,79.28,100.0,100.0,,70.42801556420233,3,0.75,81.23655298695353,79.96479354543374,1.0,MLB,-6.3694445,100.0,70.0,82.59343806363013,17.0,Power+OBP,68.61704712863356,31505,playerId

Both of their bats are good enough to get some DH at bats, so I think both could theoretically survive even without a trade, but it cuts majorly into the projected playing time for them over the next several years. It’s a shame for fantasy, because Baldwin is proving to have one of the most exciting prospect catcher bats in the game. He destroyed Triple-A with 12 homers, a 92.8 MPH EV, a 16.2/15.6 K%/BB% and 135 wRC+ in 72 games. He has the power, contact and plate approach to be a Top 5 fantasy catcher at peak, but along with Sean Murphy, there are a few things keeping me from going too crazy. His 96 wRC+ in 52 games at Double-A was not as good as his Triple-A run. His 7.7 degree launch isn’t great and his groundball rates have been pretty high in the upper minors. His hit tool is also projected to be closer to average at best, rather than a truly impact tool. You don’t need to be all that great to be one of the top hitting catchers in baseball, but tack on Sean Murphy to all of that, and he lands more as a Top 100 prospect for me rather than one I’m really targeting. 2025 Projection: 18/5/22/.238/.307/.399/1 Prime Projection: 64/20/78/.260/.335/.438/1",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5098039215686274,0.0196078431372549,0.8366013071895425,0.0915032679738562,0.9771241830065359,48.02,,,,78.01556420233463,1,0.25,60.46206225680933,52.37472178988327,0.2,MLB,-3.677777800000001,94.13333360000001,20.0,56.24341657696498,47.0,OBP,41.08620417963425,31539,playerId

It was more of the same in the AFL with 3 homers and a 5/8 K/BB in 11 games. But the batting average didn’t follow behind with a .200 BA in the AFL and a .222 BA during that hot streak at Triple-A, and I’m not sure it’s purely bad luck. He only had a 85 MPH EV at Triple-A to go along with a 46.9% FB%, which is a recipe for a low batting average. The Mets ballpark also isn’t the right park for that kind of profile with it being one of the worst parks for lefty homers this year. He’s had less extreme flyball rates in the past, but with the mediocre at best EV’s, I don’t think it’s going to matter much, and while he runs a bit, it doesn’t seem like he will rack up steals. He’s close to the majors and he can definitely end up a solid fantasy player, but it’s not someone I’m going after unless it’s a deeper league. – 2025 Projection:. 25/5/29/.235/.301/.395/3 Prime Projection: 76/18/74/.251/.322/.428/13",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6013071895424836,0.6535947712418301,0.5359477124183006,0.5555555555555556,0.7450980392156863,61.12,,,0.0,56.6147859922179,2,0.5,33.68579766536965,51.518029182879374,1.0,MLB,-3.1750000000000007,88.10000000000001,55.0,62.286408754863814,22.0,Power+OBP,53.34888393968872,31545,playerId

He’s going to have to earn it every step of the way, so he’s not the type of target I am going to stick my neck out for, but he is 100% a “let him come to you” target for me. He’s 6’5”, 220 pounds with an elite 75.4 MPH swing and a well above average 28.3 ft/sec sprint. We are talking about an absolutely elite, electric athlete here. He wasn’t great in his MLB debut with a 33.8/4.6 K%/BB% and 84 wRC+ in 19 games, so the hit tool is definitely a risk, but his 31.7% whiff% wasn’t too bad, and he dominated Triple-A with a 149 wRC+ and 22.1/13.3 K%/BB% in 25 games. I’m willing to take on that extra risk for the type of athlete he is.

It sure feels like he’s the favorite for the starting 2B job right out of the gate, which is a big boost to his value. Unfortunately, that big boost still doesn’t boost him very high in my book. The power is lacking with only 7 homers, a 5 degree launch, and a 2.2% Barrel% in 122 games at Triple-A, and so is the speed with 13 steals in 19 attempts. An elite plate approach is his game with a 12.7/18.8 K%/BB%, which led to a .293 BA, .437 OBP, and a 132 wRC+. His 88.6 MPH EV also isn’t bad, so while it hasn’t led to homers, it could be good enough to maintain the high BA/OBP on the MLB level. If he were potentially hitting atop a really good lineup, I could see real fantasy value here, but in the White Sox lineup, the fantasy value is likely to be lacking for the next few seasons. I can see a path to a solid fantasy player, but it’s not a journey I’m looking to go on. – 2025 Projection: 63/11/49/.255/.320/.386/7 Prime Projection: 84/15/61/.276/.352/.416/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3202614379084967,0.3202614379084967,0.5032679738562091,0.13071895424836602,0.7124183006535948,38.69,,,,66.34241245136187,1,0.25,51.41536964980544,43.1438793774319,0.36,MLB,-3.9972223000000007,97.96666760000001,24.0,48.917663953229564,43.0,OBP,39.956282298953305,31580,playerId

That hot streak got him selected in the 10th round, and he has showcased some of the best athleticism in the Astros system since signing for a below-slot $97,500. A lingering hamstring injury ruined his 2024 season, when he slashed .214/.302/.408 with 11 homers and 15 steals in 70 Double-A games. Cole creates at least plus raw power with a combination of bat speed, strength and the loft in his left-handed swing, and he can drive the ball out of the park from foul line to foul line. But his approach is scary because he'll get overly aggressive at times, swinging through pitches in the zone and too passive at others, letting offerings he should mash instead pass by for strikes. His 38 percent strikeout rate last year lifted his career mark to 33 percent, and his continuing difficulties with southpaws (.491 OPS, 48 percent K rate in 2024) make him look like a platoon player. If he can make consistent contact, Cole has the tools to be a star. He has plus speed and basestealing savvy, giving him legitimate 30-30 upside. After playing mostly left field at Ball State, he has become a quality defender in center as a pro. He also comes with double-plus arm strength and has notched 22 assists in 177 career starts in the outfield.

CC before his first two seasons at Oregon State were limited by the pandemic and a shoulder injury, then won the 2022 Pacific-12 Conference player of the year award by hitting .360/.424/.671 with a school-record 83 RBIs in 2022. He generated some first-round buzz but surprisingly lasted until the end of the second round, where the Astros were delighted to sign him for $1 million. He reached Triple-A by 2024, and Houston declined to give him up in the Justin Verlander trade with the Mets in 2023. Melton made his Major League debut in June 2025 but didn’t graduate because of limitations caused by a sprained right ankle. The Astros traded Melton to the Rays as part of a three-team swap in December. Melton's left-handed swing has never pleased scouts, though the Astros helped him tighten it and reduce the big leg kick he employed in college. His bat speed and strength create plus raw power to all fields, and Houston wanted him to attack pitches more out in front of the plate so he can drive the ball in the air more easily and produce more in-game pop. He lets the ball travel deep but still struggles to identify non-fastballs, which lead to struggles against breaking balls and southpaws. He improved on that trend at Triple-A but still struggled against non-fastballs in his 78 MLB plate appearances. A plus runner, Melton is a prolific and successful basestealer who may have more outfield range than any Houston farmhand. He's a quality defender in center field with an average arm that's more than playable. He could compete with veteran signing Cedric Mullins for the starting center field gig with Tampa Bay in 2026.

And considering how great of an athlete he is, I love the leash he is almost certain to get. He’s 6’2”, 208 pounds with plus speed and above average power. He cracked 15 homers with 30 steals in 105 games at Double-A and Triple-A. The reason why I’m so excited by the opportunity and leash, is that he might need it as the hit tool and plate approach are below average with a 23.5/7.0 K%/BB%. He’s also not a huge lift and pull guy, which isn’t the worst thing for his type of profile (speed and hard hit ability), and it doesn’t go extreme in the way direction either, so I’m not too worried about that. Is it possible he ends up a kinda fringy major leaguer who shows flashes but just doesn’t have the hit/plate approach to thrive? For sure that is a very realistic outcome. But I lean upside for fantasy, which Melton has plenty of, and when you combine it with proximity and opportunity, that is a profile I want on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 21/6/24/.228/.292/.402/8 Prime Projection: 77/19/75/.248/.319/.438/24",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.803921568627451,0.8366013071895425,0.6993464052287581,0.8496732026143791,0.5326797385620915,75.88,88.46153846153845,,,90.6614785992218,2,0.5,76.283111343909,76.02108897036814,0.648,MLB,-3.1194445,87.433334,46.2,77.65532679111044,30.799999999999997,Power+OBP,57.0515638559997,31661,playerId

He broke a hamate as a sophomore at Central Florida in 2022, but he still played well enough for the Dodgers to take him in the third round, making him the second-highest drafted position player in Knights history. After a so-so first full pro season in High-A, he batted .260/.387/.442 with 18 homers and 31 steals in 136 games while reaching Triple-A last year. Freeland's swing decisions rank among the best in Los Angeles' system, and he ranked sixth in the Minors with 91 walks in '24. A switch-hitter, he makes more contact and has more impact from the left side of the plate, though he did improve his righty production last season. He has a quick bat and good feel for launching balls in the air to his pull side, which could translate into 20 homers per year. While he's an average runner, Freeland's advanced instincts allow him to play quicker than that on the bases and at shortstop. He covers ground to both sides and has reliable hands and plus arm strength, ingredients that add up to solid defense at short. He also has seen action at second and third base and has a floor of a utilityman, but he definitely profiles as an everyday player at shortstop.

That was enough for me to target him late, and look at him just two years later, getting major mainstream hype. Please ignore the fact that he actually didn’t crack my 2024 Top 1,000 after his lukewarm year in 2023 😉 … but my point still stands, pro debuts mean a lot, and certainly when you are looking for late round sleepers. And now that he is getting rained down with hype, I hate to be that guy, but I think he might be getting overrated now. A lot of his damage and hype came from dominating High-A in 23 games, but he was 22 year old and repeating the level. He was good at Double-A too with a 127 wRC+, but a .245/.370/.422 triple-slash isn’t exactly blowing the doors off, and he struggled at Triple-A, slashing .243/.335/.396 with a 26.8% K% and 85 wRC+ in 39 games. The bottom line is that he hit under .250 at the age appropriate levels of the upper minors with a pretty high strikeout rate. He has very real hit tool risk. But enough raining on his parade. He’s definitely exciting with an above average to plus power/speed combo, jacking out 18 homers with 31 steals in 136 games. He hits the ball hard and he’s fast, so those numbers aren’t a mirage. He also has a good infield glove, so his glove should only help him get in the lineup. Whenever a former deep sleeper blows up, they will always hold a fond place in my heart, but perceived value shifts, and my feelings on a player have to shift with percieved value. Right now, I think he might be a tad overrated even though I still like him. – 2025 Projection: 17/3/19/.229/.293/.378/5 Prime Projection: 77/19/71/.248/.324/.421/21",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5163398692810458,0.5490196078431373,0.6895424836601307,0.48366013071895425,0.47058823529411764,55.14,88.88888888888889,70.58823529411764,,75.68093385214007,3,0.75,72.21269094347132,61.11544183021496,1.0,MLB,-4.083333400000001,99.00000080000001,70.0,63.5116326690645,17.0,Power+OBP,59.83023486107903,31665,playerId

He hit only 9 homers, there isn’t big raw power in here, and he’s not a guy looking to hit dingers with a low launch, all fields approach, so he doesn’t project for big power either. The biggest blow to his fantasy value is that he isn’t a good base stealer, going 23 for 34, and he’s not a true burner, so his upside on the bases is questionable too. I don’t think we should underrate the fact that he was 20 years old at Double-A, and that includes the power/speed numbers, so I don’t want to to be overly harsh, but he remains a better real life than fantasy prospect, which has been the book on him since being drafted. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/17/62/.278/.349/.426/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.45751633986928103,0.4444444444444444,0.6209150326797386,0.42483660130718953,0.8888888888888888,54.24,,,,82.8793774319066,1,0.25,64.23151750972761,57.737031128404666,1.0,MLB,-5.997222300000001,100.0,40.0,62.1531093385214,27.0,Power+OBP,51.918899202334636,31680,playerId

His two-plus years in pro ball showed Beavers’ ability to do a little bit of everything -- he’s paired 26 homers with 64 steals -- while revealing he might not have one truly elite tool, and how his production can come more in the aggregate than in dominant performances. His good-not-great 2024, which Beavers finished at Triple-A, exemplified this. He hit 15 homers and stole 31 bases at Double-A, but also struggled concerningly with higher velocity and slashed .241/.343/.413. Beavers was more power than speed in college, with a swing evaluators knew needed tweaking in pro ball. But as a pro, it’s his speed and on-base ability that’s kept him productive as he worked through those swing adjustments seeking more slug. The power is just average now, though Beavers’ plate discipline and bat-to-ball skills allow him to barrel pitches with enough regularity that he still has a chance to be an average hitter. The speed remains above-average and Beavers improved on the basepaths in ‘24, taking fewer risks and picking his spots to steal bases with greater efficiency (31-for-34 in attempts). Defensively, he’s capable of playing all three outfield spots but is likely suited for left or right long-term, where his near-plus arm will play. Committing to a corner, though, will put more pressure on Beavers’ bat, which remains streaky and prone to slumps. That’s the tool that will determine whether he develops into an everyday player or a versatile depth piece with a varied skill set.

He can play all 3 OF spots and is a pretty good defensive player. There is a reason Baltimore didn’t use him as trade bait (yet). I think they like him a lot. There is going to be opportunity eventually, and he has the type of fantasy friendly skillset to go after. He’s a very athletic 6’4”, 206 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that hits the ball hard and hits the ball in the air (15 homers with a 49.1% FB% in 119 games at Double-A). He’s also fast with 31 steals. The hit tool isn’t great with a .241 BA and 22.6/13.2 K%/BB%, but the high walk rates mitigate some of that, and he has the type of power/speed combo to survive a low BA.

I named him a super deep sleeper in his FYPD class for deep leagues, and seeing him blossom has been fun to watch, but unfortunately, he’s still really only a deep league option. The power/speed combo is just far too lackluster with an 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A and below average speed. He’s also not a lift and pull guy, so he can’t fall back on that either. The hit tool and plate approach are great with a 15.6/12.8 K%/BB% at Triple-A, but that immediately didn’t transfer to the majors with a 31.3/0.0 K%/BB% in 32 PA. He was 21 and it’s a super small sample, so I’m not giving it too much credence, but considering the below average power/speed combo, that hit tool/approach needs to be bulletproof. It sure looks like a utility player to me, or a low end regular. – 2025 Projection: 11/2/13/.248/.297/.353/2 Prime Projection: 76/13/62/.276/.338/.411/10",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,95,0.37254901960784315,0.08823529411764706,0.6895424836601307,0.06535947712418301,0.6535947712418301,37.63,,,,31.517509727626457,1,0.25,24.426070038910503,33.00862451361868,0.364,MLB,-5.713888900000001,100.0,24.1,45.599087354085604,42.9,OBP,38.90458930933852,31765,playerId

For one, Anthony isn’t the best base stealer with a career 38 steals in 52 attempts (he was 21 for 28 last year), so there is risk that he doesn’t run as much in the majors as we hope. Secondly, he hits the ball on the ground a lot with an around 50% GB% in 2024, which could limit his homer upside. And lastly, there is some hit tool risk with a 23.5% K%. Now that we got that out of the way, let me just say that I obviously love Anthony, he’s a legit 50/50 coin flip with Campbell, and he’s a no doubt elite prospect. He started the season as a 19 year old in the upper minors and obliterated both Double-A and Triple-A, slashing .291/.396/.498 with 18 homers, 21 steals, and a 23.5/14.6 K%/BB% in 119 games. He crushes the ball, he has speed, he has size, he has elite age to level production, and he hit both lefties and righties well in 2024. He’s as close to a Gunnar Henderson clone as there is, and if you wanted to put him as the #1 prospect in baseball, I wouldn’t argue with you.

JC in 2019-20, sitting out the next year, then resurfacing at Rio Honda (Calif.) JC in 2022, having a big summer with the Alaska Goldpanners and signing for $75,000 as a nondrafted free agent. His backstory is similar to that of Ben Rice, another Yankees offensive-minded catcher/first baseman who got limited exposure in college but stood out in summer ball. Flores was named the system's 2024 Minor League player of the year after slashing .279/.379/.495 with 21 homers in 122 games between High-A and Double-A. He put up good numbers at Double-A in 2025, earning a July promotion to Triple-A before being sent to the Pirates as part of the David Bednar Trade Deadline deal. Flores has generated plus raw power and registered some of the best exit velocities among Yankees farmhands before the trade. A right-handed hitter, he employs a pull-heavy approach designed to crush balls to left field, and he could tap into even more pop if he could make more consistent contact and lift more balls in the air. He has a disciplined approach but comes with in-zone swing-and-miss issues, though Pirates scouts are bullish about his offensive upside Though he's bigger than most backstops, Flores moves OK for a 6-foot-4, 232-pounder and continues to improve behind the plate as he gets more reps. He still needs to refine his receiving, framing and blocking but looks more and more like a viable slugger who can catch and play first base. He has average arm strength, but inconsistent mechanics and accuracy led to 115 steals against him at an 84 percent success rate in 67 starts last year.

He also so easily passes the eye test at 6’3”, 220 pounds with a smooth righty swing that looks like an MLB swing . I mean, his offensive power upside is no joke. He’s already 24 years old, the hit tool has risk as you can see from that strikeout rate, and he’s not a particularly good defensive player, but it’s so easy to fall in love watching his swing. I like him, but a bench bat is probably his most reasonable outcome. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/18/65/.241/.317/.437/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,95,0.7647058823529411,0.5228758169934641,0.38562091503267976,0.5294117647058824,0.23529411764705888,52.87,65.21739130434783,,,17.12062256809338,2,0.5,31.586801443636155,45.42088050527265,1.0,MLB,-3.2861112000000006,89.4333344,55.0,56.1197643115818,22.0,Power+OBP,50.84056082021182,31991,playerId

He broke his left foot running the bases midway though his Draft year in 2022, then reinjured it after signing for $3.75 million as the 16th overall choice, which led to surgery to replace a screw with a bone graft and delayed his pro debut until June 2023. He broke the foot again last April, costing him nearly three months, but he has slashed .317/.387/.517 in two pro seasons and .313/.417/.522 in two trips to the Arizona Fall League. Few players in the Minors can match DeLauter's combination of size (6-foot-3, 235 pounds), athleticism, ability to hit for both average and power, and plate discipline. He rarely strays from the strike zone and makes repeated hard contact against all types of pitches. He has an unorthodox left-handed swing that can get long and he'll get caught on his front foot at times, but his bat speed and strength allow him to pull pitches for power and drive them the other way with authority. An average runner, DeLauter has been more conservative on the bases in pro ball compared to college because of his repeated foot injuries. He has seen time at all three outfield positions and is a capable defender in center field, and his plus arm strength fits nicely in right field. He generated low-90s fastballs when he pitched on occasion at James Madison.

He broke his foot pre draft in 2022 which required surgery, and then he broke that same foot this year while running the bases. This one didn’t require surgery and wasn’t as serious, but at 6’3”, 235 pounds, those feet are going to continue to take a beating. He was able to return from the 2nd broken foot only to have a hamstring strain end his regular season about one month later. He dominated the AFL after the season, so that also wasn’t serious, but the injuries are starting to get concerning. They seemed to have stopped him from running at all this year with only 1 steal in 45 total games (although he stole 2 in 12 games in the AFL). The injuries haven’t stopped him from raking though. The hit tool and plate approach look truly elite with a 13.4/11.6 K%/BB%, and he has big power with 7 homers in 36 upper minors games. One of those homers was an inside the park job, which showed off his athleticism. He’s a special talent with above average to plus across the board skills, but he has to stay healthy, and staying healthy looks like it might entail not stealing a ton of bases, which does hurt the fantasy value a bit. – 2025 Projection: 16/5/19/.256/.320/.439/2 Prime Projection: 90/26/84/.278/.351/.472/11 Update: He just can’t shake the injury bug.

He hit 4 homers in 124 games all season. He doesn’t lift, he doesn’t pull, and while the hit tool is solid, it’s not standout.

He was a 5th round pick in 2023, but he was young for his college class, and there could be some late bloomer traits with it taking a bit longer to get his swing down pat with long levers. He’s gone through multiple batting stances and it still doesn’t exactly look comfortable to me. He’s never hit a ton of homers even in college with more of a line drive, all fields approach, but clearly there is more in the tank in a perfect world. It’s not a perfect world though, and I’m not sure Colorado is going to be the team to get the most out of him.

That is just brutal for his type of profile, and with a below average sprint speed, it doesn’t seem like there is much hope for him to really be a major contributor in steals. And without that, there is just no upside in this profile at all with legitimately bottom of the scale power. He had a 84 MPH EV with a 2% Barrel% at Triple-A, and a 85.4 MPH EV with 0 barrels in the majors. He’s a relatively thin and projectable 6’3”, so I definitely don’t think it’s impossible for him to gain power in his mid to late 20’s, but that is an extremely low point to start from. Of course what you are buying is the truly elite contact rates with a minuscule 4.3% K% at Triple-A and a 9.7% K% in the majors, but even with that, he’s going to need to hit the ball harder to truly take full advantage of that. This just isn’t the type of profile I go after in fantasy, but in deep leagues where safety gets a bump, I could see going higher than this. – 2025 Projection: 73/5/42/.273/.328/.381/7 Prime Projection: 88/10/50/.291/.356/.405/10",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.477124183006536,0.8758169934640523,0.1568627450980392,0.8758169934640523,0.9869281045751634,61.25,,,,78.79377431906615,1,0.25,61.06517509727625,61.18531128404669,0.272,MLB,-4.683333399999999,100.0,21.8,67.04309338521401,45.2,Power,47.7493920233463,33266,playerId

The Astros took the suburban Houston product 28th overall, making him the first Cornhuskers first-rounder since Alex Gordon 18 years earlier and signed him for a below-slot $2,478,200. He reached Triple-A in his first full pro season despite losing six weeks to back issues, hitting a combined .265/.384/.481 with 15 homers and 32 steals in 79 games between four stops. The bat speed in Matthews' right-handed stroke and the strength in his compact 5-foot-11 frame produced some of the highest exit velocities in the 2023 Draft. He drives the ball in the air consistently and possesses at least plus raw power that plays from the left-field line to right-center, giving him the potential for 25 or more homers per season. After he struggled in his pro debut, the Astros helped him make adjustments to his swing and approach to try to help him make more regular contact. He rarely chases pitches but has more in-zone swing and miss than is desirable, resulting in a 31 percent strikeout rate in 2024. One of the best athletes in the system, Matthews accounted for 54 touchdowns in his high school senior season as a Texas all-state quarterback. He has plus speed and uses it to steal bases and cover plenty of ground at shortstop, though he likely won't stay there because he has merely average arm strength and sails his throws when his footwork gets out of whack. He also played third base last year but may project best and have a greater opportunity in Houston at second base, with center field as a fallback option.

I wish I could raise the victory flag and truly explode him up the rankings, but unfortunately the hit tool was a bit worse than hoped. He was hanging in there with a 26.8% K% at High-A, but it immediately jumped to 33.7% at Double-A, and then 39.6% to close out in the season in 12 games at Triple-A. He’s now in the Puerto Rican Winter League and has a 35.3% K% in 20 games. Sure he’s 5.4 years younger than average in that league, but he’s already a 22 year old college bat who could conceivably break into the majors this year, so he’s not that young for that level really. The dude obviously has a very real strikeout problem, and I can’t just gloss over it. I comped him to Tommy Pham last year, and I predicted like Pham, it could take into his mid 20’s for the hit tool to click, but when it does click, the returns will be very big. I’m sticking with that timeline. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/74/.233/.318/.431/26",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5228758169934641,0.6209150326797386,0.5294117647058824,0.49673202614379086,0.14379084967320266,49.32,100.0,85.71428571428572,97.22222222222221,87.15953307392996,4,1.0,91.51774133778025,64.08920946822309,1.0,MLB,-4.644444499999999,100.0,85.0,61.35276284046692,12.0,Power+OBP,62.808743278210116,33280,playerId

Ohtani just went 54/59 while rehabbing from internal brace or whatever super secret surgery he underwent. Keaschall ain’t Ohtani, but point being, I don’t think the surgery should ding his value too much. And his value was starting to get pretty exciting with him proving the profile will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .281/.393/.439 with 8 homers, 9 steals, and a 19.1/12.0 K%/BB% in 58 games at Double-A. He doesn’t have huge raw power, but he hits the ball fairly hard, and can definitely lift and pull it with a 35.3% GB% and 50.3% Pull%. He’s got speed, he gets the bat on the ball, and he has a good approach. It’s possible the good but not great tools will play down a bit on the major league level, and he’s also not a particularly good defensive player, so he’s going to have to hit. But a lift, speed, contact, approach profile is a lot of boxes to check, and the profile is fantasy friendly. – 2025 Projection: 18/4/12/.247/.304/.399/5 Prime Projection: 82/19/72/.266/.334/.436/19",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.30718954248366015,0.12418300653594772,0.5816993464052288,0.13725490196078433,0.9019607843137255,38.25,,,,85.21400778210116,1,0.25,66.0408560311284,47.97679961089494,0.576,MLB,-5.058333399999999,100.0,29.4,50.43053988326848,37.6,OBP,42.93374294747082,33321,playerId

Baseball scouts see a little man, and they immediately shave a few inches of projection right off the top. I don’t mind it, because it consistently creates excellent buying opportunities for the right players (see my 19 Dynasty Baseball Strategies/Thoughts for 2025 for more on this), and Matt Shaw is definitely one of those right players. He went a little later than he should have in the real MLB Draft, then he went a little later than he should have in Dynasty First Year Player Drafts, and now he’s getting ranked a little later than he should be on prospect lists. He’s an elite prospect that gets ranked like a merely good one. He’s under 6’0”, but his bat packs a true punch, putting up an 89.3 MPH EV with a 14.6 degree launch in 35 games at Triple-A. He smoked 21 homers on the season in 121 games split between Double-A and Triple-A. He’s not a pull machine, but a lot of these lift and pull machines put up some pretty low batting averages, and a profile like Shaw doesn’t need to only pull the ball. He can use his hard hit ability, plus speed (31 steals), and plus contact rates (18.2% K%) to do damage when he goes oppo. He also walks a ton with a 11.9% BB%, making him a likely top of the order bat. Don’t fall into the little man trap, Shaw is going to be a do everything fantasy terror when he gets his shot, and with the Isaac Paredes/Cam Smith trade, that shot is coming on Opening Day. Shaw’s been a target for me from before his junior year of college, and he remains a target for me. – 2025 Projection: 71/17/65/.256/.318/.419/22 Prime Projection: 96/23/83/.276/.348/.461/26",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7450980392156863,0.7973856209150327,0.7320261437908496,0.6928104575163399,0.9477124183006536,77.33,,,,99.0272373540856,1,0.25,76.74610894941632,77.1256381322957,0.548,MLB,-4.2833334,100.0,28.700000000000003,80.66919143968872,38.3,Power+OBP,56.296136147859926,33322,playerId

An ankle injury limited him on the mound as a high school senior but didn't stop him from leading Madison HS (Vienna, Va.) to its second state Class 6 title in three seasons. Signed for $3,997,500 as the 16th overall pick, he advanced from Single-A to Triple-A at age 19 in his first full pro season, earned top prospect honors in the High-A Northwest League and led all Minor League teenagers in homers (23) and slugging (.516) while ranking second in OPS (.885) and fifth in wRC+ (137). Despite his youth, Eldridge produced better exit velocities than most Minor Leaguers last season. He has an exceptionally quick left-handed swing and plenty of strength and leverage in his 6-foot-7 frame, earning top-of-the-scale grades for his raw power from many evaluators. He chased fastballs out of the zone and had contact issues against non-fastballs in Double-A and Triple-A, but fatigue may have been an issue, and he has plenty of time to make adjustments. He should hit for a decent average and draw his share of walks while challenging for home run titles in the Majors. Eldridge has below-average speed but can flash solid run times under way and is more athletic than most players his size. After spending his pro debut in right field, he had a rough introduction to first base in 2024, committing 18 errors (mostly on fielding miscues and failed catches) in 100 games. He has a stronger arm than most at his position and displayed a 92-96 mph fastball and low-80s slider as an amateur.

I love Eldridge. He is so clearly a beastly power bat at 6’7”, 223 pounds with 23 homers in 116 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. But let me just bring up a few reasons why maybe not quite enough risk is being factored into his current humongous fantasy hype. For one, his hit tool is a legitimate risk with a 25.3% K%, and it was high in the AFL too with a 34.8% K% in 10 games. Sure he made it to the upper minors as a 19 year old, and while he didn’t embarrass himself or anything, he didn’t dominate either with only 1 homer in 17 games. His FB rates and launch are fine, but he’s not exactly a launch machine. And lastly, San Francisco is death on lefty homers. Eldridge has the power to overcome that, so I’m not going too crazy there, but combined with the swing and miss and moderate launch, that is a trifecta of negatives which tells me to maybe have just a small amount of restraint here. Again, I love Eldridge. He’s a special power bat. I just give this negatively tinted blurb relative to the monster hype he’s already getting, and maybe something to at least keep in mind when you are dealing in trade talks involving him this off-season from either direction. – 2025 Projection: 29/10/36/.227/.301/.423/2 Prime Projection: 88/32/97/.258/.342/.495/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5490196078431373,0.8627450980392157,0.27450980392156865,0.7647058823529411,0.07843137254901966,52.45,100.0,100.0,100.0,95.52529182879378,4,1.0,98.43385214007782,68.54434824902724,1.0,MLB,-7.238888899999999,100.0,85.0,64.41080447470817,12.0,Power,64.18486201361868,33390,playerId

He stole 25 bases in 100 games in the upper minors, and then he stole 12 bags with a double plus 29.3 ft/sec sprint in his 31 game MLB debut. He only stole 6 bases in 71 games his junior year of college, and then went 3 for 7 in his pro debut, so I can’t blame anyone for not expecting it, but it’s clearly a real skill he has, and it makes Crews insanely exciting for fantasy again. He combines the speed with above average contact rates (19.7% K%), above average chase rates (26.6%), and plus power (94.7 MPH FB/LD EV in the majors and a 90.2 MPH EV in the minors). The only quibble in his profile is the low launch (8.8 degrees), but he has the skillset to make that work, and he only needs to raise it a bit higher to be in a completely fine range, which I’m betting he will. The Langford vs. Crews debate might not end up as easy as we thought, and with Crews not really being considered in that lofty tier anymore, there could be a buy window here this off-season. If you can buy off the relatively subdued hype and .641 MLB OPS, I would be all over it. He also has a lock on a full time job. He’s my #1 prospect in baseball, non Roki Sasaki division. – 2025 Projection: 81/21/76/.259/.334/.448/26 Prime Projection: 94/27/97/.278/.359/.481/28",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.23529411764705882,0.16993464052287582,0.4117647058823529,0.1895424836601307,0.40522875816993464,27.59,,,,99.80544747081711,1,0.25,77.34922178988326,45.00572762645914,0.44,MLB,-4.588888900000001,100.0,26.0,43.67621828793774,41.0,OBP,38.70429822957198,33541,playerId

He slashed .288/.386/.433 with 13 homers, 12 steals, and a 23.0/13.5 K%/BB% in 112 games split between Double-A (145 wRC+) and Triple-A (97 wRC+). His 86.3 MPH EV at Triple-A isn’t super impressive, but he knows how to lift and pull it, so he should get the most out of his raw power. He’s also a good athlete who likes to run relative to other catchers, so that can help his fantasy value even if the homer totals aren’t huge. He had a crystal clear path to Boston’s starting catcher job of the future (and the present), but with his trade to Chicago, he now has to battle it out with Edgar Quero. You have to think Teel is the favorite for most of the at bats, but that might be a bad assumption, and at the end of the day, that will get decided on the field. The trade probably doesn’t change Teel’s dynasty value too much in the grand scheme of things, but it’s a ballpark hit, organization hit, and a bit of a path to playing time hit. – 2025 Projection: 31/7/34/.244/.311/.383/4 Prime Projection: 74/17/68/.268/.342/.430/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7908496732026143,0.7254901960784313,0.8104575163398693,0.7777777777777778,0.3137254901960784,71.71,,,,80.93385214007782,1,0.25,62.7237354085603,68.5648073929961,0.944,MLB,-4.558333399999999,100.0,38.599999999999994,75.00994221789882,28.400000000000002,Power+OBP,57.21447399805447,33549,playerId

It looks like he literally unhinges his shoulder to turn his body into a cannon, absolutely unfurling on the baseball. Here is what I wrote about a homer Campbell hit in early September in the in-season Dynasty Baseball Rundowns: “on his latest homer, I think he dislocated his shoulder with one of the most bad intentions swings I’ve seen .” Underscoring my visual evaluation of that explosive shoulder movement is that shortly after that homer he hit the IL with a lat strain, which is right under the shoulder blades. Campbell underwent a well documented swing change and bat speed training to unlock more power last off-season, which was obviously successful beyond anybody’s wildest imagination, so let’s just hope that it’s not going to cause more injuries. That is the only small thing that is even rattling around in my brain as a negative, because the season he just had was nothing short or spectacular. He slashed .330/.439/.558 with 20 homers, 24 steals, and a 19.9/14.3 K%/BB% in 115 games spread across 3 levels (A+, AA, AAA). He was just as dominant in the upper minors as he was at High-A with across the board domination. He hits it hard, he has a good feel to hit, he has a good approach, he has size (6’3”, 191 pounds), he has bat speed, he can lift it, and he has speed. You can be hesitant to fully buy in because it feels like he came out of nowhere, but he put up a 1.033 OPS in 45 games in the ACC in 2023, a .932 OPS in 58 games in 2022 in the Northwoods League, and then a .911 OPS in 22 games at mostly High-A in his pro debut, so it’s not his fault that everyone underrated him. He always had a good feel to hit and good approach, and he always had the frame and athleticism to tack on more power, so I’m not going to hold it against him that he wasn’t more hyped (4th round pick in 2023). He still didn’t lift and pull the ball a ton with an under 40% Pull% and under 30% FB%, but he knew when to pick his spots (as you saw with that homer video above), and he has the type of profile that can thrive without an extreme lift and pull profile. I’m all in on Campbell. He’s an elite prospect who is knocking on the door of the bigs. 2025 Projection: 58/13/51/.252/.324/.423/15 Prime Projection: 98/26/89/.277/.356/.478/26",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.42483660130718953,0.2679738562091503,0.5522875816993464,0.2679738562091503,0.21568627450980393,37.08,,,,99.41634241245137,1,0.25,77.0476653696498,51.068682879377434,1.0,MLB,-4.927777800000001,100.0,40.0,50.714604863813236,27.0,OBP,46.771572188715965,33644,playerId

He skipped over stateside complex ball after the pandemic but appeared at High-A for four straight seasons until breaking out in 2024. After finally breaking through to Double-A in May of that year, he was traded to the Blue Jays two months later in the Nate Pearson deal and struggled in his introduction to the Toronto system. He returned to New Hampshire to begin his age-23 season in 2025 and took off once again, reestablishing himself as one of the best outfield prospects in his second organization. A left-handed hitter, Pinango displayed good bat-to-ball skills early in his career but would expand the zone too much in pursuit of contact, leading to rough power. His walk and chase rates have improved in recent years, and by adjusting the base in his stance, he’s been able to keep the bat in the zone longer. His bat speed has impressed Jays officials early in 2025, and he uses it to turn on inside fastballs and better tap into his solid raw power, though he still needs to prove that pop can regularly hold at the upper levels. One of his biggest improvements early this summer has been cutting down on harmless infield popups, thus giving himself a better shot at hits. A below-average runner, Pinango is limited to the corner outfield spots, and with average arm strength, he’s a better fit in left. That puts a larger emphasis on his bat. Pinango, who was first Rule 5-eligible in 2022, is trending toward being a hit-first fourth outfielder.

His power began to emerge in 2024, when he led the Triple-A International League with 40 doubles, 61 extra-base hits and 244 total bases, though his batting average (.256) and on-base percentage (.365) were career lows. Following the offseason trade of Andrés Giménez to the Blue Jays, Brito will get the first chance to replace him at second base in Cleveland. Yet another switch-hitting Guardians infield prospect, Brito always has made consistent contact and controlled the strike zone from both sides of the plate. He also has displayed the aptitude to launch balls in the air to his pull side, though he produced just 31 homers in his first 296 pro games before bashing a career-best 21 last year. He did a better job of driving the ball as a righty after struggling to do so in 2023. Brito isn't much of a threat on the bases with his fringy speed, though he will steal on occasion. He has quick hands but lacks smooth infield actions and has just decent arm strength, which limits his defensive value. He has played all over the diamond and grades as a fringy defender at second base, right field and first base compared to below average at shortstop and third base.

But his season at Triple-A was too good to ignore. He slashed .256/.365/.443 with 21 homers, 13 steals, and a 16.1/13.5 K%/BB% in 144 games. The 87.3 MPH EV isn’t great, but it’s not terrible, and it came with a 17.5 degree launch and a 47% Pull%. We know that a strong plate approach with a lift and pull profile can most certainly work. If he can get into the lineup, and he has opportunity at 2B before Bazzana arrives, he should be a rock solid MLB hitter, but his glove could cause problems on that front long term. – 2025 Projection: 22/5/27/.241/.302/.394/2 Prime Projection: 76/20/79/.259/.328/.430/8",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4166666666666667,0.9583333333333334,0.2777777777777778,0.7777777777777778,0.5138888888888888,56.49,38.095238095238095,78.57142857142857,,57.003891050583654,3,0.75,53.45197222858014,55.42669028000306,0.656,0–1 yr,-2.1666667000000004,76.0000004,61.400000000000006,59.097507144000915,25.6,Power,50.23387829480042,sa3009808,playerId

After reclassifying from the 2021 Draft, he went in the third round in 2020 and signed for an over-slot $1.75 million. He has made more contact and provided less pop than expected, but he was enjoying his best pro season in 2025 when the Red Sox traded him to the Cardinals at the Deadline for Steven Matz in a one-for-one swap. While Jordan's bat speed and strength have created impressive exit velocities throughout his pro career, his aggressive approach has muted his well-above-average raw power from the right side of the plate. Swing-and-miss concerns dogged him during his amateur career, but strikeouts haven't been an issue in the Minors. He's making a higher quality of contact this year by being more judicious about what pitches he offers at, giving hope that he could turn into a .250 hitter with 20 homers annually at the big league level. Jordan has to produce at the plate because he's a well-below-average runner who's a subpar defender on the infield corners. He has soft hands and decent arm strength, but he lacks range. Primarily a third baseman in his first four seasons, he has spent more time at first base this year.

He has good raw power despite hitting only 7 homers, and being 21 years old at Double-A is still on the slightly young side. He doesn’t have much defensive value, but he can play a decent 3B, so it’s not like he doesn’t have any at all. I doubt he finds a role on the Red Sox, but I’ll take a shot on his contact/power combo at this point in the rankings. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 67/18/76/.266/.315/.421/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5972222222222222,0.6666666666666666,0.3888888888888889,0.6666666666666666,0.9861111111111112,62.62,26.923076923076927,,,4.863813229571989,2,0.5,11.946897136585855,44.884413997805055,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.402777799999999,90.83333359999999,55.0,61.531324239341515,22.0,Power,53.555762627703686,sa3014537,playerId

Signed for $2.5 million back in July 2019, the exceptionally talented outfielder has had all of his tools on display … when he's been able to stay on the field. Despite missing time with a knee injury in 2022, an abdominal strain in 2023 and a thumb injury in 2024 -- he's yet to play over 100 games in a season -- he still made it up to Triple-A last year and has a career .932 OPS heading into the 2025 season. While the injury bug has found him repeatedly, the Twins are buoyed by the fact that there haven't been recurring injuries and the fact Rodriguez will be just 22 years old for all of the 2025 season. When he's been on the field, he's displayed raw power, bat speed and excellent pitch recognition. With a K rate close to 30 percent in his career, he is going to have to cut down on his strikeouts, though he does offset that with a ton of walks (21.9 percent rate). He hits the ball extremely hard and can drive it to all fields. Rodriguez runs well enough to steal the occasional base and to cover enough ground in center field, where he's played almost exclusively to date. If he slows down, he could slide over and be the prototypical athletic, strong-armed right fielder with the power profile to match. Assuming health, his bat could start banging on the big league door soon.

He played in only 47 games this year due to a nagging thumb injury, and he played in only 47 games in 2022 due to a meniscus tear (knee). He did get in a mostly full season in 2023 though (he missed a few weeks with an abdominal strain), and he got in a full rookie ball season in 2021, so I’m hesitant to officially slap the injury prone label on him. It’s something to take into account to break a tie, but his upside is way too high to meaningfully move him down the rankings because of it. He’s a power/speed/OBP beast with 9 homers, 9 steals, and a .459 OBP at mostly Double-A in 47 games. It was good for a 203 wRC+ at the level. He crushes the ball, he lifts it, and he’s an excellent athlete who plays CF. Injuries aren’t the only concern though, he also has strikeout problems with a 29.7% K%. Some of it is because of how patient he is, but definitely not all of it. I wouldn’t say Minnesota’s OF is wide open, but Minnesota already announced how they want to limit Buxton to like 100-110 games next year, and while they have solid options for their corner spots, they are far from locked down. If Rodriguez is healthy and producing at Triple-A, it might not be long before he gets the call to the majors, and there is potential for monster fantasy impact, especially in an OBP league. – 2025 Projection: 36/10/31/.224/.310/435/8 Prime Projection: 92/29/89/.248/.342/.490/24",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9027777777777778,0.4027777777777778,1.0,0.4305555555555556,0.08333333333333337,64.62,89.28571428571429,57.14285714285714,,97.47081712062257,3,0.75,76.9620990419514,68.939734664683,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.6000000000000014,93.20000000000002,70.0,70.2029203994049,17.0,OBP,61.68131417973221,sa3014693,playerId

And that thing is of course double plus power. He’s a power hitting bull at 6’1” with 40 homers and a 90.6 MPH EV in 137 games in the upper minors. He swings and misses a lot (24.6% K%), he doesn’t walk (5.8% BB%), he hits the ball on the ground way too much (50%+ groundball rates), he’s bad on defense, and he doesn’t steal bases. There is actually one other thing going for him, which is that he’s been very young for the upper minors in 2023-24, and he’ll still be just 21 years old for almost half of the 2025 season. There is time for him to improve his plate skills and launch. If he can, he has the upside to be one of the best power hitters in baseball, but even if he can’t, there is a role for a guy who can hit 30+ homers even if that is all he does well. Miami should also have plenty of opportunity for him if he’s raking. – 2025 Projection: 61/22/72/.228/.280/.435/0 Prime Projection: 73/31/88/.256/.314/.495/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1527777777777778,0.2777777777777778,0.1527777777777778,0.25,0.45833333333333337,23.26,,,,85.40856031128405,1,0.25,66.19163424124513,38.28607198443579,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.9083334,96.9000008,40.0,38.81382171533074,27.0,Contact,40.79621993189883,sa3015168,playerId

He has that perfect mix of talent, upside, production, path to playing time, and absolutely non existent hype. He’s 6’2” with a big righty swing that has easy plus power potential, and he used that to club 16 homers in 128 games at Double-A. He’s not a burner but he loves to run, stealing 25 bags in 34 attempts, and I don’t see why Chicago wouldn’t let him run, especially if they are going to be bad for the next few years. And the most exciting part is that he at least hinted at improving his well below average plate approach in the 2nd half of the season with a 23.2/8.7 K%/BB% in his final 70 games. He was only 21 years old in the upper minors with a 118 wRC+, and his biggest weakness, the plate approach, showed signs of improving.

(The Red Sox took pitcher Jeremy Wu-Yelland in Round 4.) Rosario has shown flashes of offensive potential, like when he won the Midwest League MVP and then tied for the Arizona Fall League lead in home runs in 2023. That raised expectations for 2024, but an elbow injury that forced him out of action for two months somewhat derailed his progress, though he did make up for lost time with a return engagement in the AFL. Since entering pro ball, Rosario has displayed the ability to hit the ball very hard, but he’s also been one to get off to slow starts and then heat up as the year goes on. That was happening again in 2024 when he landed on the injured list as he started to show he could make adjustments to the sharper breaking balls he saw in Double-A. Early on, his swing had gotten flatter and he was chasing more than he used to. There is always going to be swing-and-miss to Rosario's game with a power-over-hit profile, but he was starting to figure things out and he always offsets the K’s with a healthy dose of walks. As a right-handed-hitting corner outfielder, Rosario is on the wrong side of a platoon and he’s going to have to really consistently mash to be an everyday player. The Twins didn’t protect him from Rule 5 Draft last December and he wasn’t taken, but he has the kind of work ethic in which he can use that to earn a 40-man spot this year, when he’ll still be just 22 for most of the season.

And he’s making sure he gets seen with an absolute 113.1 MPH rocket for his first homer . He’s 1 for 7 with 2 strikeouts overall. We all know that Rosario is a power hitting beast, and he hit 8 homers in 67 games in Double-A this year, but the reason he didn’t crack my End of Season Prospect Rankings is because I don’t like the 30.4% K% and 54.2% GB% combo. Huge power conquers all, so I’m not saying he can’t overcome the K’s and groundballs, but I don’t love it.

That didn’t go well, but a repeat of the level in 2022 led to an MVP award and an OPS north of 1.000 for the summer. He hit well in a full season with Single-A Fort Myers in 2023 then continued to swing the bat well in 2024, reaching Double-A for the first time. A right-handed hitter, Olivar has made excellent progress at the plate over the past two seasons. He has the chance to perhaps be an above-average hitter, one who has kept the strikeouts in check while improving his overall approach and walking at a career 13.4 percent clip heading into 2025. Better swing decisions have continued to enable him to barrel up the baseball and get to his power more consistently. He can drive the ball to all fields, though his home run pop has come mostly to his pull side. His defense hasn’t come along as quickly as his bat, though the Twins do think he has the chance to catch in the big leagues. He’s a tireless worker who is bilingual, works with pitchers well and calls a good game. There’s still work to be done on his arm strength and receiving, but there’s hope it’s trending toward Major League average. He’ll continue getting reps in the outfield, with the versatility giving his bat a better chance of reaching the big leagues.

He suffered a torn labrum in his right shoulder on a dive back to first base in his International League debut on March 29 and underwent surgery that forced him out for the rest of the season. The injury was poor timing for one of the game's top catching prospects as he looked set to make a Major League impact in 2024 based on the strength of his defense alone. A Minor League Gold Glove winner in 2023, Quero has long earned praise for his overall work behind the plate. He's used a right-knee-down positioning to steal strikes as a quality framer and moves well behind the dish to help his blocking as well. He possesses at least plus-plus arm strength with quick pop times, but Milwaukee limited him to part-time DH duty early in 2025 to protect the shoulder and a hamstring injury he picked up in the spring. Offensively, Quero still projects as a close-to-average bat with decent power, capable of pulling homers to left or slicing doubles the opposite way when needed. His 16 homers for Double-A Biloxi during his age-20 season in 2023 represented a career high. A season's worth of lost at-bats certainly haven't helped, as his exit velocities haven't caught up to that projection and he's chasing a lot in his biggest taste yet of Triple-A. But Quero's defense alone gives him a high floor, and with William Contreras holding down the catching spot in Milwaukee, the younger backstop should get all the developmental time he needs.

Shoulders are important for hitting, and they are also very important defensively for a catcher. It definitely adds in some risk that needs to be taken into account. He’s also very clearly blocked by William Contreras who isn’t a free agent until 2028, and I don’t think Milwaukee is going to have any urgency to move either of these guys, so Quero might have to wait until 2028 to take over the starting catcher job. Injuries and playing time aside though, Quero is an excellent catcher prospect with an above average hit/power combo and good defense. He hit 16 homers with a 17.8/10.0 K%/BB% in 90 games at Double-A in 2023. He can easily be a top 10 fantasy catcher at peak, and there is top 5 upside as well. If there was a clear path to playing time, I would rank him considerably higher than this. – 20 25 Projection: 11/4/15/.245/.304/.408/1 Prime Projection: 65/20/74/.268/.329/.448/4",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7083333333333334,0.8055555555555556,0.7222222222222222,0.8472222222222222,0.9444444444444444,78.15,85.71428571428572,71.42857142857143,,74.70817120622569,3,0.75,71.20712487329563,75.71999370565348,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.2055556000000003,88.4666672,70.0,78.96849819169606,17.0,Power+OBP,64.67915762626323,sa3015407,playerId

He’s a small guy at 5’7” with high ground ball rates, so the power upside is very limited. He has speed, but he started to get caught a lot in the upper minors, and the plate skills dropped off in the upper minors too. He’s likely a utility infielder, but the Marlins entire infield is far from locked down, so he’s on the right team for opportunity. I still think Miami has better options than him though. – 2025 Projection: 18/2/11/.246/.299/.351/6 Prime Projection: 61/9/42/.262/.323/.388/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.16666666666666666,0.027777777777777776,0.2222222222222222,0.05555555555555555,0.875,22.6,,,,19.455252918287936,1,0.25,15.077821011673148,19.967237354085604,1.0,0–1 yr,-2.8527777999999984,84.23333359999998,40.0,31.055171246225676,27.0,Contact,34.771493780801556,sa3015579,playerId

His first two summers of pro ball -- the Dominican Summer League in 2021 and the Florida Complex League in ‘22 -- didn’t make anyone sit up and take notice, but that changed when he hit his way to full-season ball in 2023, then managed to perform well across two levels of A ball in '24. Alfonzo is a strong left-handed-hitting catcher who is starting to punish the ball more consistently as he physically and emotionally matures. He hits the ball very hard and could be just a little more consistent elevation away from being an impact-type hitter. He started tapping into his power to his pull side mostly in 2024, but Alfonzo is still hitting a lot of ground balls and low line drives, and some small adjustments should allow him to drive the ball to all fields. He’s always been willing to draw walks and work counts. Growing up around the game and the craft of catching, Alfonzo has a strong sense of what he’s doing behind the dish. He’s working to improve his throwing accuracy, but he has enough arm strength to have thrown out 30.7 percent of potential basestealers in his career heading into 2025. He works well with pitchers, is bilingual and is a solid overall receiver. If he starts lofting the ball at the plate more, he could take off as a catching prospect.

He placed seventh in the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League batting race (.322) while making his U.S. debut in 2022, but missed the first two months of the next season with a torn meniscus in his right knee and looked less athletic than usual while navigating Single-A. He bounced back in 2024, ranking fifth in the Minors in hitting and doubles (38) while slashing .330/.379/.499 between two Class A stops. Part of Cleveland's seemingly endless supply of switch-hitting middle infielders with strong bat-to-ball skills, Genao is proficient from both sides of the plate but shows more pop as a righty. He has a quick, compact stroke and commands the strike zone very well, though his ability to make contact easily cuts into his walk totals. Fully recovered from his knee injury, he did a better job of using his lower half and hitting the ball harder last year, but his relatively flat swing may cap his home run output at 15 per season. Genao ran better in 2024, displaying solid speed at times and stealing 25 bases in 30 attempts. He has smooth middle-infield actions, quick hands and a strong arm, which should allow him to remain at shortstop. He also saw action at second and third base last year and is at least a solid defender at all three spots.

He played well there late that summer and again the next season, but he has struggled ever since being promoted to High-A in August 2023. After joining the White Sox as part of the package for Dylan Cease in March 2024, he slashed .187/.340/.301 in his first year in his new organization. Zavala ranked fifth in the Minors with 177 walks in 2023-24, but he was more passive than patient and pitchers took advantage. He's turning his left-handed stroke loose more often this year, though he swings and misses too much in the strike zone. He has gotten stronger and is doing a better job of turning on and lifting pitches while producing more encouraging exit velocities, hitting at 15-20 homer power. Though he's more of an average runner, Zavala's instincts allow him to steal a few bases and get the job done in center field. His solid arm strength plays at all three outfield spots. He didn't turn 21 until mid-July, and Chicago hopes that decelerating his rush through the lower levels of the Minors will pay off with development at the plate.

He was particularly productive at the start of his career, with an .892 OPS during his debut in the Dominican Summer League after signing, hitting .321 and reaching full-season ball during his first visit stateside in 2022, then finishing with an .837 OPS and 18 homers in 2023 while touching High-A. He was sent to the Twins just ahead of the 2024 season in the Jorge Polanco deal and wasn’t nearly as productive in his first year with his new organization. Though Gonzalez put up very pedestrian numbers with High-A Cedar Rapids last year, there were some underlying traits that were still positives. The right-handed hitter made a ton of contact, striking out in just 14.5 percent of his plate appearances. He can absolutely punish fastballs, but it’s a very aggressive approach that can lead to too much chase, especially against softer stuff. While he hit the ball harder on average than most hitters at his level, there were too many ground balls. His power production suffered because of that, as well as because of a lower back issue that bothered him for much of the second half of the season. Gonzalez’s ability to recognize pitches better, elevate and drive the ball more consistently is key to his future profile. He’s a corner outfielder only, one with at least a plus arm, so he’s going to have to unlock that power to be an everyday guy in the big leagues.

He jumped to full-season ball rather quickly with an assignment to the Florida State League in 2022 and returned to Single-A ball for 2023 with sharper plate discipline. His 2024 campaign was his fullest yet with 110 games between High-A Peoria and Double-A Springield and 13 more in the Arizona Fall League, where he fit right in among some of the game’s top prospects. A switch-hitter, Bernal does a solid job of swinging at pitches inside the zone, and he's done an impressive job of cutting down in his entire whiff rates back in the Texas League in 2025, His swing-and-miss can be more pronounced from the right side at this stage, likely because he’s gotten so many more plate appearances as a lefty so early in his career. There’s above-average raw power in Bernal’s 6-foot frame, and he did a better job of tapping into it during the 2024 regular season with a career-high 11 homers. Even if he can elevate more on contact, he could hit 15+ over a full campaign, even against tougher arms. Bernal has long impressed folks in the St. Louis organization with his work ethic, and despite being a well-below-average runner, he moves well enough to be a good blocker and framer behind the plate. He is an efficient and effective thrower on stolen-base attempts, and his 35.2 percent caught-stealing rate was best among High-A qualifiers last season. (It's risen into the 40s with Springfield this season.) Bernal will be Rule 5-eligible next offseason and should have a good 40-man case as a well-rounded backstop.

He struggled in a small taste at Double-A with a 68 wRC+ in 14 games, but the 16.4/10.9 K%/BB% shows he was far from overmatched. He’s also a pretty good defensive catcher. Bernal is a very solid catcher prospect who is probably on the underrated side, although he projects as more of a solid around hitter rather than a true beast. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 67/17/72/.258/.327/.421/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5321100917431193,0.7155963302752294,0.4724770642201835,0.7247706422018348,0.7981651376146789,61.9,88.0,0.0,,38.521400778210115,3,0.75,38.61329823758297,53.74965438315404,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.552777800000001,80.63333360000001,70.0,62.26489635494622,17.0,Contact,55.5958700797258,sa3015773,playerId

After an All-Star turn in the 2022 Arizona Complex League, he delivered a bigger breakout a year later with 24 homers (second-most among catchers in the Minors) and a .962 OPS in 94 games for Single-A Rancho Cucamonga. Liranzo struggled to repeat that success in the Midwest League in 2024 and was slashing just .220/.344/.356 through 74 games with High-A Great Lakes when Los Angeles traded him to Detroit, along with Trey Sweeney, for Jack Flaherty. He popped off after the deal (.315/.470/.562 in 26 games for West Michigan) and continued that momentum in the Arizona Fall League, where he won Fall Stars Game MVP. A switch-hitter, Liranzo showed more slugging ability from the right side, where he bats from a more straight-on stance compared to his more open one on the left, entering 2025, but it’s at least plus pop from both. His exit velocities routinely eclipse triple digits and occasionally go above 110 mph as he generates strength from his big frame. That loud contact, coming mostly to the pullside, helps drive most of Liranzo’s offensive profile, but he’ll take his walks too. His High-A turnaround came when he started making more direct contact with the ball, turning ground balls and infield popups into stung line drives and flyballs. He's held those rates but hasn't quite driven the ball out of the yard as much in 2025. Liranzo is a well-below-average runner, and while he makes for a big target behind the plate, he still faces questions over whether he’ll be athletic enough to last at catcher. He has plus arm strength at least, and even though he had first-base experience in the L.A. system, Liranzo only featured at catcher with Detroit. He is Rule 5-eligible next offseason, and despite some slips in Double-A, the bat alone should be good enough to get him closer to the Motor City.

He’s also decimating the AFL with a 1.158 OPS in 15 games. He came over in the Jack Flaherty trade along with Trey Sweeney, so you know Detroit loved this kid, and he proved them correct very quickly. He’s a big boy at 6’2” with a powerful swing from both sides of the plate. He’s not a lock to stick behind the plate, but he has the bat to profile at 1B/DH, and I don’t think Detroit makes this trade if they thought he couldn’t stick there. Detroit doesn’t have a strong organizational catcher depth chart at all, so they have every reason to stick with him there. He profiles as your classic low BA slugging catcher if he sticks. He’s less exciting as a 1B/DH prospect, but still not a bad prospect there either. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/24/73/.242/.323/.460/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3119266055045872,0.6697247706422018,0.27522935779816515,0.3853211009174312,0.04587155963302747,35.75,85.18518518518519,,,74.5136186770428,2,0.5,67.1160890137868,46.72813115482538,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.9472223,73.3666676,55.0,44.685939486447616,22.0,Contact,42.48200628890143,sa3015790,playerId

He burst onto the radar as an Arizona Complex League All-Star in 2022 and even saw time at Single-A Carolina and High-A Wisconsin that same summer. He hit .306 with four homers in 103 games back in the Carolina League a year later and jumped to the Midwest League for 2024, when he was the circuit’s leader in average (.301) and doubles (30) over 110 games. Areinamo was back with Wisconsin for 94 games in 2025 when he was traded to the Rays in late July for Major League catcher Danny Jansen. The right-handed hitter has one of the most interesting hitting setups in baseball, taking the bat off his shoulder as the pitcher delivers and whipping it forward in the air almost like a lasso. It’s worked for him so far with solid contact rates, but his eagerness to expand the zone brings concern to his hitting profile. Some see a batter who can still spray the ball around the diamond. Others worry the chasing will catch up to Areinamo at the upper levels. He needs a solid average to bring value because he isn’t likely to get on base through walks, and his limited power lowers the ceiling more. The 5-foot-8 infielder is a fringy runner but doubled his career high in steals to 32 in 2024. He’s moved around the dirt plenty early in his career, in part because Milwaukee was so loaded with great defensive shortstops in the lower levels, but he’s proven to be a strong fit at second base with good reactions and lateral movement but just an average arm. Even with that glovework, Areinamo might be headed toward being a utility player in the Majors if he can’t hone in more on the zone as a hitter.

I imagine if they ever drew Micky Mouse playing baseball, they would have him swing something like Areinamo. It’s amazing that he has elite contact rates with that swing, but he does with a 11.1% K% and .301 BA in 110 games at High-A. He doesn’t have big raw power with only 10 homers at 5’8″, and he’s not a burner despite 32 steals, so I don’t think his fantasy value is huge. But if the elite contact rates stick in the upper minors, he’ll be interesting for deeper leagues. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/9/42/.268/.321/.387/16",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7431192660550459,0.7431192660550459,0.5596330275229358,0.8623853211009175,0.9174311926605505,74.09,0.0,,,10.116731517509725,2,0.5,5.016212710765239,49.91417444876784,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.3444445000000016,78.13333400000002,55.0,67.44375243463035,22.0,Contact,53.67635539558366,sa3015802,playerId

He finished his debut in the Dominican Summer League with a .301 average and a .847 OPS then hit a combined .333/.372/.536 during his United States debut in 2022 that included the complex league, full-season ball and a Trade Deadline deal to the Reds for Tyler Naquin. After hitting .309 in and winning Dominican Winter League Rookie of the Year honors that offseason, he moved up to High-A Dayton in 2024 where his numbers were more muted, though he hit .274 with a 106 wRC+ at age 20. Rodriguez has always been hitterish from the left side of the plate. He’s at his best when he’s more gap-to-gap and sending line drives to all fields. He has started to tap into more power and it’s shown up more to his pull side. He is an aggressive hitter who chases out of the zone frequently but keeps the swing-and-miss in check, with a strikeout rate under 15 percent in his career to date. The hope is he’ll become a better hitter as he climbs the ladder and pitchers are around the zone more, with the concern being that better pitchers will be able to exploit his free-swinging tendencies. While Rodriguez played a good amount of center field in winter ball, he’s more suited to a corner spot long-term, which of course puts more pressure on his bat. He’s worked hard to become a more solid defender with a chance to profile as a valuable fourth outfielder in the big leagues.

A switch-hitter who does a little of everything but lacks an above-average tool, he adopted a more aggressive approach in 2024. He slammed 15 homers, exceeding his total of 13 in his first three seasons, but also hit a career-low .229 and got overwhelmed by Double-A pitching following a mid-August promotion. Castro has better bat-to-ball skills and more power from as a left-handed hitter, with 14 of his 15 homers coming from that side last summer. He makes good swing decisions and can work counts to draw walks, though he got too passive in Double-A. He hit the ball harder than ever in 2024, but he also struck out more frequently and still didn't pull balls in the air with much consistency. Castro has average speed out of the batter's box, moves quicker once underway and shows good instincts on the bases and in the outfield. He plays a decent center field, though his range probably would fit best in Fenway Park's spacious right field, and his arm grades as an average. Boston declined to protect him on its 40-man roster in November, and his floor as a reserve outfielder stands out more than his ceiling as a regular.

The team was aggressive with him early, sending him right to Single-A Columbia in 2022 as an 18-year-old. He has spent three seasons there making incremental progress with his game. In 2024, Vazquez slashed .253/.353/.289 with a 13.2% walk rate, 22.2% strikeout rate and a 99 wRC+. He missed about six weeks with a hamate injury and finished his season in the Arizona Fall League, hitting .298 with a .744 OPS in 14 games. Vazquez has always been a defense-first shortstop with good hands, instincts and agile movements that make the Royals believe he can stick at the position. Offensively, Vazquez has made slow but steady progress just with his hit tool and really increased his line-drive rate in ‘24. He’s in a better neutral position with his swing, which helps, and he’s also stronger and more physical after four seasons in pro ball. Vazquez flashed raw power when he was an amateur and still has good bat speed now, but the power has yet to show up in games. It might be more extra-base hit potential than anything. Vazquez has a strong arm and is an above-average runner. After three years, Vazquez headed up to High-A Quad Cities for 2025. His defense plays, and the Royals will stick with him as a shortstop, but he’ll have to show just a bit more offensively to reach his ceiling, which is likely as a utility player who can get on base unless he really finds something with his bat.

He earned All-Star accolades in the Single-A California League in 2023 and in the High-A Northwest League last season, which he concluded by hitting .313 in 42 Double-A games at age 20. He's not overly toolsy but has the highest ceiling among San Francisco's middle-infield prospects. Velasquez has a controlled approach at the plate, making consistent contact to all fields while rarely chasing pitches out of the zone. A switch-hitter with a quick, compact swing from both sides, he does more damage as a righty. He did a better job of lifting pitches in 2024 but still lacks the strength to hit more than 10 homers per season. Velasquez's instincts allow him to play a bit quicker than his average speed on the bases and in the field. He has been a steady defender at shortstop in the past but his average arm and range are better suited for second base, where he has spent almost all of 2025. He'll project more as a contact-hitting utilityman than a big league starter unless he can provide some more offense.

He didn’t get off to a very promising start to his pro career in 2021, spending two summers with very modest numbers in the Dominican Summer League. Things started to click a little bit in 2023 as he hit his way from the Arizona Complex League to full-season Modesto and finished with a .951 OPS. He wasn’t quite as consistent in his return to the Nuts in 2024, though he did help them win the California League title after topping the circuit with 15 homers and 90 RBIs. A switch-hitter with strength at the plate, Suisbel has the chance to have above-average raw power in the future. He got too aggressive at the plate in 2024, getting a bit too swing-happy, leading to fairly high miss and chase rates. His strikeout rates have always been elevated, but because he was performing better in 2023 and last year, the Mariners didn’t want to mess with it too much. But there remains work to be done in refining his approach so he can tap into that pop. Suisbel does have some interesting defensive traits that work well from the left side of the infield, with a very strong arm, good hands and footwork. He’s not particularly athletic, though, so that probably means an eventual full-time move to first base, where the power will have to show up against better pitching for him to have the chance to profile there.

The progress halted a bit in 2024 as he struggled for the first time back with Dayton. He finished with a .686 OPS, though the Reds think there were some signs of positive development at the end of the season before a sprained left thumb ended his year in August. When he's swinging the bat well, Jorge uses his left-handed swing to send line drives to all fields. He'd added strength to his 5-foot-10 frame to provide a little more extra-base thump. But he lost his approach for much of the 2024 season, and while he showed he was capable of reaching the seats to his pull side, he got too pull happy, leading to more strikeouts and fewer walks. He was seeing the ball a bit better in the second half and embracing using the middle of the field more prior to his injury. Jorge has used his plus speed well on the basepaths, with 114 steals over four summers. It also serves him well as he continues to get used to the outfield, something the Reds introduced to Jorge, who initially signed as a shortstop, in 2023. He'll keep getting some ground balls at second base, but look for him more often in center field, where the Reds think he's superior defensively.

He ranked as the consensus top prospect in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League during his 2022 U.S. debut, but his progress came to halt when he subluxated his left shoulder on a swing the following May and required season-ending surgery. He slashed .221/.303/.354 with a system-best 38 steals in 95 games between two Class A stops last year while continuing to showcase the best all-around tools in the system. Bleis combination of electric bat speed, still-growing strength and the loft in his right-handed stroke give him more raw pop than most 21-year-olds. He could produce 25 or more homers per year without swinging for the fences, but he sells out for power with an overly aggressive approach focused on launching balls to his pull side. He generates impressive exit velocities when he connects but will need to improve his swing decisions to find consistent success. Though he has gained at least 25 pounds of strength since turning pro, Bleis has retained his plus speed and turns it loose on the bases. He makes some shaky decisions at times in center field but also has the quickness to overcome a lot of his mistakes and plays as a solid defender there. His plus arm strength helped him notch 22 assists in 174 outfield starts during his first four seasons.

So I fear Bleis is going to get comfortable in this breakout waiting room, but that is where he is after another mediocre at best season. He conquered Single-A with a 123 wRC+, but he was a 20 year old repeating the level, and he struggled when he got to the more age appropriate High-A with a 70 wRC+ in 50 games. That hit tool is still quite raw with a .221 BA on the season. The good news is that the upper echelon talent is still here with 11 homers, 38 steals, and a lift and pull profile. The hit tool isn’t good, but a 21.4/9.1 K%/BB% isn’t too bad. He also has a good glove in the OF. Is he just Alex Ramirez 2.0? Probably. But even Alex Ramirez can still breakout down the line, and Bleis certainly can too.

He won High-A South Atlantic League MVP and Rangers Minor League player of the year honors in 2023, when he topped the Minors in slugging (.619) and ranked fourth in homers (33) and OPS (.990). He recovered from a rough first half at Double-A last year to bat .309/.412/.636 with 15 homers in his final 43 games. Ortiz’s power took him to Triple-A in 2025, and after he was added to the 40-man roster in November, he was traded to the Nationals two months later as part of the MacKenzie Gore deal. Ortiz's bat speed in his lefty stroke and his strength give him well-above-average raw power that plays to all fields, and he began to tap into it more often when he stopped swinging for the fences. A more selective approach helped him find better pitches to attack, enabling him to hit them harder and drive them in the air more frequently. He tightened his strike zone in 2024, cutting his K rate to 22 percent from 27 percent the year before, but struggled against breaking balls and left-handers. Most of Ortiz's value will come from his offense because he's a well-below-average runner with fringy arm strength. He's a decent defender at first base, though he needs to reduce his errors. While he has looked better than expected as a right fielder in the Arizona Fall League and Double-A, the outfield corners are still a stretch because of his limited range.

He’s 5’10”, 230 pounds with a howitzer of a lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. He’s not a good defensive player and he was bad vs. lefties (.623 OPS in 107 PA).

While Cauley’s bat-to-ball skills haven’t translated to pro ball, he has shown promise in other phases of the game and with his nonstop energy. He slashed .235/.297/.411 with 35 extra-base hits and 27 steals in 93 games at High-A in 2024, missing a month early in the season with turf toe. After displaying a smooth right-handed stroke with plenty of bat speed and good feel for the barrel in high school, Cauley has had in-zone swing-and-miss issues as a pro. He gets overly pull-conscious and swings with so much effort, resulting in a 29 percent strikeout rate last year. He does hit the ball hard when he makes contact and could deliver 15-20 homers per season, but he may never provide much in the way of batting average or on-base percentage. A Texas all-state wide receiver in high school, Cauley has plus-plus speed and uses it aggressively on the bases, stealing 111 bags at an 89 percent success rate in 297 games during his first four seasons. His quickness also allows him to cover plenty of ground at shortstop, where he has solid arm strength but doesn’t always make accurate throws. He’s much more reliable at second base and has the tools to become a dynamic center fielder, though he hasn’t played there as a pro.

He once again put up a 29.2/8.4 K%/BB% in 93 games at High-A, which just isn’t going to get the job done. But he remains on the back of this list because he’s a true talent. He’s lightning fast with 27 steals in 29 attempts, and he has both raw and game power with 12 homers. He also has a potentially plus up the middle glove. His glove and pure talent should eventually get him on an MLB field, but it’s likely a case where the hit tool isn’t good enough until his mid to late 20’s, if it ever gets good enough at all. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 51/14/46/.226/.300/.415/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6697247706422018,0.8853211009174312,0.42201834862385323,0.9036697247706422,0.3027522935779816,64.54,47.82608695652174,,48.38709677419355,18.482490272373543,3,0.75,31.67626468239459,53.03769263883811,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.5333334,68.4000008,70.0,61.66830791165144,17.0,Power,52.88073872024315,sa3017167,playerId

He won Arizona Fall League Offensive Player of the Year honors in 2023, then encored by making the Futures Game and finishing second in the Double-A Southern League in hitting (.300) and strikeout percentage (10 percent) at age 21. He batted .302 in the final month following a promotion to Triple-A. Triantos' bat-to-ball skills from the right side of the plate drew comparisons to Alex Bregman and David Wright when he was an amateur, and they rank among the best in the Minors. He has tremendous feel for the barrel and rarely swings and misses, though his flat stroke and mildly aggressive swing decisions lead to too much groundball contact. He has slugged just .417 through four pro seasons, with most of his home runs coming on pull shots down the left-field line, and he may max out at 10-15 per year. Triantos has gotten faster since turning pro and now features solid speed that helped him swipe 47 bases in 56 attempts last season. Improved quickness has increased his range at second base, where he's a fringy to average defender with reliable hands and solid arm strength. Chicago has given him some brief action in center field the last two years, and he could be a capable corner outfielder, albeit with less-than-desired power. He has a similar profile to Luis Arráez, with a tick less hitting ability but a bit more pop and defensive value.

I’m leading with that because it gives his profile an upside boost which he needed for fantasy. The contact rates have consistently ranged from plus to elite throughout his minor league career, putting up an 11.1 K% this season, but both the game power and raw power are well below average. He put up a 85.9 MPH EV at Triple-A with a 2 degree launch. He doesn’t walk much with a 5.6% BB%, which isn’t great for his chances to hit at the top of the lineup, and he’s not really an asset on defense as a solid 2B. The hit/speed combo is certainly good enough to make him a good fantasy prospect, but lack of impact, OBP and defense keeps him just outside the Top 100. – 2025 Projection: 19/2/11/.260/.303/.365/7 Prime Projection: 81/11/52/.282/.328/.408/26",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1111111111111111,0.2361111111111111,0.18055555555555555,0.3472222222222222,0.8611111111111112,28.21,55.55555555555556,0.0,85.36585365853658,72.95719844357977,4,1.0,52.22878639292229,36.616575237522795,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.5138889000000013,92.16666680000002,85.0,40.32547259125684,12.0,Contact,51.77979602606558,sa3017295,playerId

He hit 19 homers with an 89.3 MPH EV, 19.4 degree launch, and a 53.6% Pull%. The .210 BA and 28.1% K% is why the wRC+ was so low, and that probably does limit is reasonable upside projection to a bench bat. He’s a righty that didn’t hit righties that well either (.648 OPS), so it’s also a short side of a platoon bench bat. First Base seems especially weak to me up and down the rankings, so he also cracks this list purely on 1B scarcity. – 2025 Projection: 11/3/14/.218/.292/.400/0 Prime Projection: 36/12/42/.231/.316/.436/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.07339449541284404,0.25688073394495414,0.26605504587155965,0.05504587155963303,0.12844036697247707,16.09,,,,0.1945525291828787,1,0.25,0.15077821011673095,10.511272373540857,0.892,1–2 yr,1.5,32.0,37.3,16.80288171206226,44.7,Contact,14.716296770428015,sa3017326,playerId

He changed his approach in 2024, looking to attack fastballs early in counts, and doubled his previous career total by homering 24 times to rank fifth among Minor League catchers. He's also more athletic than most backstops and now looks like the future starter the Marlins hoped he would become. Mack's quick left-handed swing and strength produce plus raw power that plays to all fields. He works deep counts and doesn't chase too often, but his approach got too passive at times in the past. He struggles to deal with breaking balls and changeups, so he has compensated by looking to do damage whenever he gets a fastball in the zone, and he did a better job of pulling and lifting pitches last year. Also a basketball and volleyball player in high school, Mack is agile behind the plate and pounces on grounders in front of him. He has soft hands and has developed into a solid receiver and framer as he has gained experience and improved his focus. He has a plus arm and gets rid of throws quickly, which helped him erase 34 percent of base stealers last season.

A lot of 21 year old’s have that power breakout as juniors in college, while Mack had his at Double-A. It resulted in a well above average 129 wRC+. He’s built like a catcher at a strong 6’0”, 210 pounds with a powerful lefty swing, and he’s known as a good defensive player. Since Agustin Ramirez’ catcher defense is shaky, Mack very well might be the odds on favorite to be the Marlins catcher of the future. And they can certainly share the position with Ramirez getting at bats at 1B/DH as well. The 25.7/9.7 K%/BB% shows there is hit tool risk, so he likely profiles as your classic low BA, slugging catcher. – 2025 Projection: 10/4/14/.218/.283/.392/0 Prime Projection: 53/21/64/.242/.313/.431/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6944444444444444,0.8472222222222222,0.4722222222222222,0.8194444444444444,0.3055555555555556,64.49,83.33333333333334,53.84615384615385,,74.90272373540856,3,0.75,65.85001555246463,64.96600544336262,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.4250000000000007,91.10000000000001,70.0,68.6243016330088,17.0,Power,60.550935734853965,sa3017374,playerId

He tore the patellar tendon in his left knee while pursuing a flyball during his first Spring Training, requiring surgery that cost him the entire 2022 season. He showed flashes of talent without posting loud numbers the next two years and went unpicked in the Rule 5 Draft in December after the Cubs opted not to protect him on their 40-man roster. Up in Triple-A for the first time in 2025, Franklin started hitting the ball with more authority and was dealt to the Nationals at the Trade Deadline in a three-player swap for Michael Soroka. Franklin hits the ball hard and has a disciplined approach that helped him lead the Double-A Southern League in on-base percentage (.398) and walks (71) last year, but he also makes a lot of ground-ball contact and struggles with sliders and changeups, leading to inconsistent offensive production. He displays plus raw power in batting practice, yet doesn’t drive the ball in the air in games, and four of his five homers last year snuck out down the right-field line. His right-handed swing gets long and he'll miss some hittable pitches in the zone. An average runner out of the batter's box but quicker underway, Franklin stole 34 bases in 41 attempts last season. He makes good reads and takes good routes in the outfield, where his range grades as average in center and solid on the corners. He played all three outfield spots in 2025 with a primary focus on center. His arm plays from anywhere, aiding his chances at being a fourth outfielder in his new organization.

Since signing with the Twins for $1.7 million as a 2021 supplemental first-rounder, he has provided much more defense and less offense than expected. Traded to the Dodgers for Manuel Margot and infield prospect Rayne Doncon in February 2024, he slashed .244/.318/.315 between High-A and Double-A last season. Some club officials believe Miller could win a Gold Glove in the big leagues this season if given the opportunity. With his slick actions, strong and accurate arm, soft hands and finely calibrated internal clock, there's not a play he can't make at shortstop. He's as reliable as he is spectacular, committing just six errors in 123 starts at short in 2024. A switch-hitter, Miller makes consistent contact but has provided little impact from either side of the plate. The Dodgers hope they can help him develop double-digit home run pop by improving his swing and approach, but he slugged just .317 in his first four pro seasons. He has average speed with good instincts on the bases, though he was a bit slower than that last year while playing through a meniscus injury in his left knee.

Signed for $4,540,790, he batted .232 with a 35 percent strikeout rate in his first full year as a pro and got demoted for a month after making a threatening gesture toward an umpire. Part of an August 2023 trade for Josh Bell, he continued to struggle that season and the next but is making progress while repeating Double-A this year. Watson still has the quick left-handed swing and plus raw power that made him attractive as an amateur. He's starting to learn that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs and is showing more discipline at the plate in 2025. He may never hit for a high average and strikeouts always will be part of his offensive package, but his pull-heavy approach could lead to 20 homers per season. Signed as a shortstop, Watson spent the majority of his time in the outfield in 2024 and has moved there full-time this season. With solid speed and arm strength, he's capable of playing all three outfield spots. He's an average defender in center, his primary position, and can refine his instincts as he gets more experience.

He just put up a 30.7% K% with a .220 BA in 96 games at Double-A. He was only 21 years old, so there is some age to level leeway you can give him, and he still put up a 104 wRC+, so he wasn’t bad. The electric power/speed combo that made him a hyped high school prospect is still here with 16 homers and 15 steals. Even with the hit tool risk, I still like him for fantasy, but he has to get on the field in order to help us. And it just doesn’t seem like a team is going to hand him a full time job anytime soon.

The adjustment wasn’t the smoothest, but things began clicking at Single-A Delmarva in 2023 and Willems hit himself to Double-A in 2024 as a 21-year-old before capping the year with a solid stint in the Arizona Fall League. His 2025 was more uneven, though he did hit 16 homers, and the Orioles left him off the 40-man roster, but he was not selected in the Rule 5 Draft. Willems has an attractive profile as a left-handed hitting backstop with excellent raw power, and he’s been able to get to it in games to an impressive degree as a young player, socking 17 homers in each of his first two seasons, followed by the 16 last year. It’s power-over-hit in a strong and stocky package, with a simple swing built to drop the barrel on pitches low in the zone and drive them with authority. Willems can swing and miss quite a bit, but his approach is maturing and he sliced his strikeout rate in Double-A and the AFL, and still kept it under 20 percent in 2025. Willems is a decent baserunner despite poor footspeed, taking extra bases when he can and rarely running into outs. Willems touched 90 mph as a two-way prep player and that strong arm has kept him behind the plate despite questions about his receiving and blocking. He isn’t an elite defender, but he’s ironed out those edges somewhat and caught better than scouts expected in the Fall League. He’s also played about a quarter of his defensive innings at first base, though a full-time move there would put more pressure on the bat to develop even further.

It’s a good sign that his K% didn’t explode at Double-A with a 18.8% K% (20.9/10.7 K%/BB% at High-A), although it came with a 2.9% BB%. He’s almost certainly going to need a trade to find a full time job, so he should be solid trade bait at the deadline. And if he ends up on a team who needs a power bat, Willems could fill that role. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/22/75/.238/.312/.441/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6788990825688074,0.8532110091743119,0.5229357798165137,0.8440366972477065,0.6422018348623852,69.96,0.0,,,38.326848249027236,2,0.5,19.003728923476004,52.1253051232166,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.8611111999999999,72.3333344,55.0,64.96559169696498,22.0,Power,51.40118314363424,sa3017562,playerId

So even after two full seasons in 2022 and 2023, the latter of which including getting dealt to the Reds in the Luis Castillo deal, and a missed 2024 season because of a torn left labrum suffered in Spring Training, he'll still be only 21 years old for the bulk of the 2025 season. Arroyo had touched Double-A in 2023 with a big up arrow next to his name, and he was able to shake off the rust from the layoff by holding his own in the Arizona Fall League in 2024. Arroyo’s time in the AFL was more about him starting to get his timing back at the plate while proving to himself that he put the injury behind him, so even though his offensive numbers were modest, those missions were accomplished. The switch-hitter swings the bat well from both sides with a contact-first approach that allows him to send line drives to all fields. Before the injury, his power started to show up more consistently and there should be more of that in the tank to come. A very aggressive baserunner with above-average speed, Arroyo likes to steal bags and take extra bases. The one thing that wasn’t rusty at all during his Fall League stint was Arroyo’s glovework. He’s a smooth defender with excellent body control, showing the ability to make all the plays and throws from all angles, with evaluators thinking he could play shortstop defensively in the big leagues right now. For now, though, he’ll get to focus on playing a full healthy year at the upper levels.

Granted, he didn’t hit very well in the AFL with a .642 OPS in 18 games, but he’s 2.2 years younger than average, and this is basically his spring training coming off a major surgery. I would only take it as a positive that he is even playing in the league. He’s a switch hitter who hits well from both sides of the plate, he has plus speed, and at a pretty skinny 5’11”, there is definitely room for him to add more power. The hit tool and approach aren’t quite good enough to get really excited for this type of profile, but if he can add real power, there is definitely potential for him to put up some super impactful fantasy seasons hitting in Cincinnati. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/17/64/.253/.320/.426/25",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.42201834862385323,0.1743119266055046,0.4724770642201835,0.43119266055045874,0.7339449541284404,42.04,75.86206896551724,58.33333333333333,,67.1206225680934,3,0.75,62.07410392709345,49.05193637448271,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.0861112000000013,75.03333440000002,70.0,49.092581072344814,17.0,Contact,48.548328362555175,sa3017626,playerId

His full-season debut was pushed back a year, to 2023, as he injured his shoulder diving back to a base in Spring Training and needed surgery to repair a torn labrum that cost him all of 2022. He hit well in Single-A in 2023 and even better at High-A in ’24, but he sustained another shoulder injury while diving in the field and had to undergo another labrum surgery -- this time a less-severe cleanup procedure -- that put him a bit behind schedule to start the year. Kinney was Tennessee’s high school Player of the Year and earned a full-slot signing bonus of $2,148,100 for the same reason he still has a chance to reach the Majors now: He can really hit. He’s often described as a pure hitter, with a simple left-handed swing and a mature approach that allow him to barrel the ball to all fields and hit for a high average. He always possessed good bat speed, and he may have tapped into more power by remaking his body during the 2023-24 offseason. He’s been a hit-over-power player, but that balance is starting to shift in 2025 with his whiff rates and homer totals both going up at Double-A Montgomery. Kinney is a below-average runner, but his physical transformation gave him a chance to stick in the infield at second and third base. Time will tell how the shoulder surgeries affect his throwing arm, potentially limiting him to second, but he dropped weight and added agility two winters ago to better handle the hot corner or middle infield. For now, he’ll likely split his time between second and third while hoping his bat will speed up his climb through the Rays’ system.

He slashed .289/.352/.494 with 10 homers, 6 steals, and a 22.2/8.9 K%/BB% in 87 games at High-A this year. It was good for a 137 wRC+. Being 21 years old at High-A is fine, but it’s one year older than optimal, and nothing really stands out in his game. He has good size at 6’1”, 200 pounds, and he has a sweet lefty swing, which are the things that got him drafted so highly out of high school, but without a standout tool/skill, he remains kinda lukewarm for fantasy. If he can keep up the production at Double-A, that will give him a bump, and there is definitely potential for a power breakout if he can start to lift and pull more. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 65/18/71/.261/.318/.414/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.44954128440366975,0.5963302752293578,0.1559633027522936,0.5779816513761468,0.2844036697247706,41.25,4.347826086956519,,,18.8715953307393,2,0.5,10.897021090622003,30.6264573817177,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.5083334000000015,68.10000080000002,55.0,42.090437334515315,22.0,Contact,40.2606969605319,sa3017793,playerId

His combination of plate discipline, sneaky power and deceptive speed fit the Tigers’ mantra for their hitting prospects, and after a strong showing in the 2023 Arizona Fall League, he displayed all of those traits in an impressive season at Double-A Erie. His season ended in mid-August when he strained his lower back on a swing. Though Lee has an aggressive fastball-hunting approach, he also has an advanced grasp of the strike zone and an ability to make consistent quality contact. His 17.9 percent strikeout rate was his lowest for a full season, despite an unexpected drop in his walk rate. He became more pull-happy last year, possibly chasing Erie’s doubles-friendly dimensions in left field, but could benefit from turning more ground balls into line drives. Despite a stocky frame, he shows good instincts and a quick step on the basepaths, stealing 16 bases in 17 tries in 2024, and he shows solid defense at second base. While Lee has the potential to be a pleasant surprise for the Tigers, his history of injuries -- including last year’s back strain and a calf injury following his trade in 2023 -- have slowed his progress while raising questions about whether his ultimate role is as an everyday player or a utility role. He’s still very young for his level, and while he hasn't dominated at Triple-A Toledo, his numbers under the hood have been better than his overall performance. He's started to see more time at third base as well as Detroit aims to solve its infield puzzle.

Signed out of Venezuela for $1.2 million, the largest bonus in the Guardians' 2022 international class, he was named the Carolina League MVP and top prospect last year. He led the Single-A circuit in walks (86 in 98 games), ranked second in on-base percentage (.414) and placed third in OPS (.812) at age 19 before breaking his left wrist diving for a fly ball in late August. A switch-hitter, Chourio shows more aptitude and power from the left side of the plate. He recognizes pitches better than most players his age, rarely chases them out of the zone and laces line drives to all fields. He has a quick swing and projectable strength and he hits balls hard, though his propensity to put the ball on the ground may limit him to 15-20 homers per year unless he makes adjustments. Chourio has plus speed and is aggressive on the bases, stealing 78 bags in 95 attempts (82.1 percent) during his first 186 games as a pro. His instincts translate into good reads and routes in center field, where he's at least a solid defender. His range and arm strength allow him to handle any outfield spot with ease.

A lot of his love gets couched in “but he’s not as good as his brother,” which isn’t quite fair, because I think there is near elite prospect upside in here, and he took steps towards that in 2024. His power didn’t explode (yet), but it did tick up with 5 homers in 98 games at Single-A (1 homer was his previous career high). He’s a still projectable 6’1” with an explosive swing, so as he gains more raw power, and as he raises his launch (49.3% GB%), there could be a real power breakout coming down the line. And he has the elite plate skills (16.0/`19.9 K%/BB%) and speed (44 steals) to do the rest. He’s yet to put up less than a 140 wRC+ at any stop of his career. This is easily a Top 30 fantasy prospect for me, and even that could be underselling him. If he gets lukewarm love in off-season prospect drafts where he’s available, you need to jump all over that. Now is the time to target him aggressively. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 98/18/68/.276/.355/.433/34",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4473684210526316,0.05263157894736842,0.9210526315789473,0.13157894736842105,0.48684210526315785,42.88,80.95238095238095,85.71428571428572,,94.3579766536965,3,0.75,81.28242542153048,56.32084889753567,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.3194444999999995,77.833334,70.0,52.1552547692607,17.0,OBP,50.48653144616732,sa3018399,playerId

After making his debut in the Dominican Summer League after signing, he looked so good out of the gate in the Florida Complex League in 2023 that the Pirates pushed him to full-season Bradenton. That didn’t go well, so they pumped the brakes and let him start again in the FCL in 2024. After a .912 OPS in 57 games, he moved up again to the Florida State League with similar results (.564 OPS in 25 games). A right-handed hitter with growing strength, De Los Santos is capable of making a ton of contact, limiting strikeouts when he was at the lower Rookie levels and drawing plenty of walks. It got dicier when he moved up to Bradenton, as he really struggled to recognize spin and saw his chase and miss rates skyrocket as a result. He was getting caught in between trying to be on time for the fastball, while seeing more breaking stuff than he did in the DSL or FCL. With his added strength, especially focused on his core, he can trust his body and his ability to be on time for the fastball while adjusting to spin more than he has previously. While he’s not a burner and could outgrow shortstop -- he’s played a decent amount of third and seen time at second -- De Los Santos has a high baseball IQ and excellent instincts. At his best, he’s a confident leader who takes control of the defense at short, so he’ll keep playing a lot at the premium position until he shows he can’t.

Infielder Michael Arroyo, who signed for $1.375 million that January, took a big step forward last year. Montes was thought to be one of the best hitters in the class and received $2.5 million to join the organization. The Cuban outfielder has followed a pattern since coming to the United States, dominating a level to earn a promotion, and finished the 2024 season as a teenager with High-A Everett. Montes' loudest tool is still his top-of-the-scale raw power from the left side of the plate, and he's continuing to learn how to get to that pop consistently in games. He has outstanding bat speed with plenty of loft in his swing to drive the ball in the air, and he can regularly register elite-level exit velocities. There is some swing-and-miss to his game and there will always be strikeouts, but he also draws walks (14.4 percent walk rate in 2024) as he's learning to find better pitches to hit. He models his game after and is often compared to fellow Cuban Yordan Alvarez. It will be Montes' bat that gets him to the big leagues. He's a below-average defender who can't run. He's a 6-foot-5 beast whose best shot is to man an outfield corner, though the risk he ends up getting a lot of at-bats as a designated hitter down the line is very real.

The first is that the hit tool is a real concern with a 26.1% K% in his 1,067 PA career in the lower minors. The 2nd is that Seattle is simply an awful ballpark to hit in. And the third is that he’s a very bad defensive player, and could end up DH only. That puts a ton of pressure on the bat, and as a lefty who hits righties much better than lefties, a strong side of a platoon power bat seems well within the range of outcomes. I do find it interesting that Bryce Eldridge has a nearly identical profile, and Eldridge is the darling of the prospect world while people seem lukewarm on Montes these days. I also prefer Eldridge, because the hit tool seems a bit safer, he’s a true unicorn at 6’7”, and he at least seems to have found a defensive home at 1B, but Montes is right there with him. He has beastly power at 6’3”, 210 pounds with 21 homers in 116 games, he’s an on base machine with a 14.4% BB%, and while the K% spiked to 29.6% when he got the call to High-A, it was starting to come down towards the end of the season, and seeing the 19.1% K% he put up at Single-A shows hope that he can improve that skill over time. He’s one of the premier lower minors power hitting prospects in the game, and his hype deserves to be damn close, if not equal to Eldridge’s, but the prospect world can be a fickle place. Even my ranking has a disparity between them, Maybe it’s just the nature of rankings. They are imperfect.

He debuted in the Dominican Summer League after signing and was a dozen games into his United States debut in the Arizona Complex League in 2023 before an injury sidelined him in late June. The Pirates still wanted his upside and acquired him when they sent Carlos Santana to Milwaukee close to the Trade Deadline. He played in three games before a broken hamate ended his season, but he rebounded with a strong 2024 in the Florida Complex League, earning a late promotion to full-season ball. Now only a right-handed hitter after starting off from both sides, Severino stands out for his ability to hit the ball hard. He had solid exit velocities in 2024, especially for his age, and he’s continued to add bat speed so those numbers can keep trending up, a big reason for his 16 homers and .528 slugging percentage as a teenager last year. He doesn’t miss a fastball and does a ton of damage with them. His overall approach continues to improve, with his strikeout rate going down while still drawing walks, though there are still gains to be made on his swing decisions. Signed as a shortstop, Severino is a pretty good athlete, but it seems less and less likely that he’ll be able to stay up the middle as he gets more physical. He might still get some reps there to help with his athleticism, but third base seems a much more likely long-term option, and he played more at the hot corner than at short a year ago, a trend that should continue.

He’s a still projectable 6’2”, 185 pounds with that absolute vicious and athletic righty swing that jacked out 16 homers in 84 games split between stateside rookie and Single-A (6 homers in 28 games at Single-A). He’s also a good athlete who stole 16 bags in 20 attempts. He was a 19 year old at rookie ball for his first 56 games of the season, so I was a little skeptical of the 15.9/11.8 K%/BB% at that level, and that skepticism proved correct as he put up a much worse 30.1/6.5 K%/BB% at the more age appropriate Single-A.

After a solid Dominican Summer League debut after signing, they skipped him over the Arizona Complex League and sent him to full-season Inland Empire. Then in 2024, he leapfrogged over High-A ball to spend the year with Double-A Rocket City at age 18. In both seasons, Rada started very slowly -- which is understandable -- then made some adjustments and held his own in the later parts of each season. While there were things to be excited about from Rada’s second half in 2024, hitting .323 in July and posting a .984 OPS in 12 September games to close things out, it’s clear the young outfielder has a lot to work on. Perhaps unfair given that he was the youngest player in Double-A last year, but he’ll need to make more consistent contact for his profile after seeing his strikeout rate tick over 23 percent last year. He also needs to add strength so he can impact the ball more. He’s never going to be a big power guy at 5-foot-8, but if he can be the kind of guy who finds the gaps and uses his speed for extra bases, it might work. Rada will also have to be sure to maintain his athleticism. He has outstanding instincts in all aspects of the game, especially defensively, and his ability to use his speed to steal bags and stick in center field is his best chance at being an every day guy in the big leagues. Just 19 for nearly all of this season, there’s still plenty of time for him to figure it out.

The one thing that is for sure is that he has impact speed and baserunning ability. He stole 27 bags in 50 games in the DSL in 2022, 55 bags at Single-A in 2023, and 35 bags in 123 games at Double-A this season. The hit tool and ultimate power projection isn’t as easy. He hit .234 with a 23.3% K% this year, but considering how young he was for the level, that can be considered pretty impressive. The only year he was at an age appropriate level, 2022 in the DSL, he hit .311 with a 12.6% K%. As a 17 year old at Single-A he hit .276 with a 18.1% K%. This could easily end up being a plus hit tool at peak with an easy and simple lefty swing. He also has a very strong plate approach with a 11.4% BB% and .331 OBP. He was excellent in that department his entire career. He’s a plus CF, so his glove will keep him on the field, and his speed gives him a decent floor for fantasy. It’s not hard to see a potent top of the order hitter … if he can do enough damage when he does make contact. He’s had extreme groundball rates his entire career (56.6% this year), he doesn’t hit the ball hard, and he’s already a decently filled out 5’8”. He’s hit just 4 homers in 288 career games and just 1 this season. That says more bottom of the order hitter than top of the order, but considering how young he is, I don’t want to rule out a power uptick down the line. If he can just get to 10+ homer power, there is impact top of the order potential in here. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/8/57/.268/.332/.372/25",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7222222222222222,0.041666666666666664,0.9444444444444444,0.3055555555555556,0.6805555555555556,56.18,66.66666666666667,50.0,97.05882352941177,49.80544747081712,4,1.0,61.15739681086443,57.92208888380255,1.0,0–1 yr,-6.086111200000001,100.0,85.0,63.27562666514076,12.0,OBP,63.67403199931334,sa3018421,playerId

The Colombia native had shown glimpses of huge offensive potential in '22 and 2023, getting to full-season ball quickly, then saw a huge jump in his production in 2024, playing across two levels of A-ball and finishing two steals shy of a 20-20 campaign. Small, compact and strong, Arroyo is a fairly physically mature middle infielder cut from a Howie Kendrick type cloth. The right-handed hitter has an excellent approach at the plate, walking in 12.8 percent of his plate appearances heading into the 2025 season. He did swing-and-miss more in '24, but with that came the ability to tap into his raw power much more consistently. He can drive the ball to all fields and he’ll have to keep reminding himself he doesn’t need to sell out to get to his pop as he moves up the ladder. He’s an average runner, but he’s aggressive on the basepaths. While Arroyo has seen time at both middle infield positions throughout his career, he skewed much more heavily to the right side of second base in '24. That’s likely the best spot for him given his arm strength and footspeed, but it’s looking like he has the chance to profile as an offensive-minded regular at the keystone in the future.

He’s completely locked in and makes hitting a baseball look easy.” But I questioned his power upside at only 5’8”, and in 2024, he answered those power questions in a resounding fashion. He clubbed 23 homers in 120 games split between Single-A and High-A, and he did it while remaining a good all around hitter, slashing .285/.400/.509 with a 23.0/12.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, and he can hit the ball hard. His swing looks damn quick to me too. He’s not a burner, but he can run a little bit too with 18 steals. There certainly seems to be some little man discount going on here, because Arroyo has a lot to be excited about. He’s easily a Top 100 dynasty prospect, and if he were 6’2”, we might be talking about him in an entirely different way.

Confined to the Dominican Summer League for his first two professional seasons as he acclimated himself to pro ball, he stood out in extended spring training and finally made his way to the Arizona Complex League last season. He held his own as a 19-year-old by hitting .257 with an .801 OPS, three homers, 10 doubles and 11 stolen bases in 48 games. On the smaller side at 5-feet-11, 150 pounds, Pacheco makes up for his lack of size with dynamic fast-twitch athleticism. He is selective at the plate with decent on-base skills, particularly for his young age. He has an athletic swing and good bat speed, which lead to good contact rates. His power numbers have been below average thus far, though he can spray line drives to all fields, giving the A’s hope that he could develop into 20-homer potential as the 20-year-old grows into his body. With plus speed that enables him to cover plenty of ground and a solid arm, Pacheco is gifted enough as a defender to stick at center field for the long term. With a well-rounded set of tools and a strong foundation to work with, Pacheco will get an opportunity to continue honing those physical tools in full-season ball as he looks to climb toward reaching his high and exciting ceiling.

Things clicked more when he came stateside in 2024, when he posted a .338/.495/.481 line in 24 games in the Florida Complex League, though shin splints limited his time on the field. When he was healthy, Escobar’s surface numbers (and the underlying data behind them) last year point to a potential breakout. Even when he wasn’t putting up numbers in the DSL, he was showing an advanced approach at the plate, with a lot of walks to go along with minimal swing-and-miss or chase. But while he was making a lot of contact, he wasn’t finding the barrel. He learned last year how to get his body behind the ball from the right side of the plate, allowing him to impact the ball a lot more consistently and start tapping into his raw power. Small, stocky and strong, Escobar is far from a burner, but he’s shown a knack for stealing bases. Defensively, he’s gotten most of his reps at second base, and he’ll continue to play there, but he also will keep getting time at third, with some in the organization thinking that could be his long-term home, with the arm and potentially the power to profile there.

These include 18 year olds repeating the DSL and 19 year olds in stateside rookie ball, but with the recent contraction of the minor leagues, I might have to loosen up my stance on that. With fewer teams, more deserving guys are going to repeat rookie ball levels, and on the flip side, Single-A is getting more rookie ball-ish itself. High-A might really be the true “full season ball” jump that Single-A used to be. It’s something to keep in mind, and something that I have to continue adjusting to myself. Enter Aroon, who destroying rookie ball as a 19 year old with a 172 wRC+, 3 homers, 9 steals, and a 9.6/20.2 K%/BB% in 24 games. I wasn’t in on him because of his age, but I’m feeling regret for that after he crushed him first homer this spring at a grown man’s 108.2 MPH. He now has a 505 wRC+ in 2 PA ;). He’s not necessarily a big tools guy, which is another reason I wasn’t in on him, but he can end up a very strong across the board contributor.

While Flores leads with his defense, Laverde’s offensive ceiling is his calling card. He’s hit at most stops and even shook off a rough start with Single-A Inland Empire in 2024, where he was sharing catching chores with Flores. Laverde went back down the Arizona Complex League to reset, then came back and posted a .296/.392/.408 line from July 1 on. All organizations love a good left-handed-hitting catcher, and Laverde checks off that box with an exciting bat profile. He does a very good job of managing the strike zone, drawing walks and rarely striking out. It’s more of a line-drive approach with some developing pop for extra bases mostly to the gaps, and he is capable of driving the ball to all fields. He’s pretty physical already, so he may not grow into a ton more over-the-fence thump, but he has the chance to be a solid overall hitter. It remains to be seen whether Laverde will be able to stick behind the plate. He was splitting time with Flores at the start of 2024, which wasn’t great for his development. Once he had the chance to get behind the dish more regularly, there was a bit more improvement and a better arm. He’s fairly athletic, and runs well underway, so there is the chance the Angels could eventually try some other positions -- perhaps a corner outfield spot, where he once played as an amateur before moving behind the dish.

But Hidalgo, another middle infielder who received a $500,000 bonus, has jumped to the forefront a bit more. It didn’t happen overnight as Hidalgo repeated the Dominican Summer League, but things really clicked for him in Round 2 in 2023, finishing with a .980 OPS en route to being named the DSL MVP. He performed well during his U.S. debut in 2024, earning a late bump up to Single-A Fresno, albeit with less impact at the plate. A right-handed-hitting infielder, Hidalgo showed a knack for finding the barrel in the DSL. But while he still made some loud contact in 2024, more chase showed up in his game. There’s a good amount of raw power for him to tap into, but he’ll need to tone down his approach more so he can get pitches to drive, instead of wave at soft stuff out of the zone too much. Hidalgo is a solid runner with good instincts on the basepaths, which helps him be a threat to steal. There is some question over whether he’ll be a shortstop long term -- his arm works from the left side of the infield and no one is pushing him off short for the time being, but he likely will get introduced to second base this year after he’s also received time at third at the outset of his career.

At 18 years old, he was older than most prospects who command seven-figure deals on that market, but he has advanced quickly. He finished 2024 in Double-A at age 20 and his 21 homers last season ranked fourth among Minor Leaguers his age or younger. Baez features more bat speed and strength and hits balls considerably harder than most players his age or in Houston's system. A right-handed hitter, he has no problem turning on pitches and launching them to his pull side and possesses at least 30-homer upside. But his swing-at-everything approach results in a lot of chases and in-zone misses and he's a sucker for sliders, so he'll have to prove he can make consistent contact against more advanced pitching. While the Astros envisioned Baez as a possible center fielder when they signed him, he has slowed down as he has gained weight and is now a below-average runner. He has good instincts but limited range on the outfield corners, where he's an adequate defender who could get more out of his plus arm if he could get to balls quickly. He'll have to stay on top of his conditioning to avoid losing more quickness and winding up at first base.

Is that even real? That looked like a cartoon or something. And while you’re at it, also check out how athletic that swing was. For such a powerful man, that is a damn athletic swing. It’s no surprise he demolished 20 homers in 92 games at High-A (and he also stole 9 bags, showing off that athleticism I was talking about). His power is no joke, and he lifts and pulls it. The problem is that the hit tool and plate approach are both double below average with a 27.3/5.4 K%/BB%. He got a cup of coffee at Double-A to end the season, and it was nice to see the 18.0/13.1 K%/BB% in 14 games, but it came with only 1 homer and a 84 wRC+. He can play some OF, so he’s not a defensive liability, but he’s not likely to add much value with the glove. The bat is going to have to hit it’s ceiling, and he still has to prove it in the upper minors, but it’s so easy to fall in love with that swing and power. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 72/27/84/.245/.316/.463/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.22935779816513763,0.23853211009174313,0.30275229357798167,0.28440366972477066,0.21100917431192656,25.23,30.76923076923077,0.0,52.77777777777778,68.8715953307393,4,1.0,39.71403272473311,30.29941145365659,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.4638889000000006,79.56666680000001,85.0,34.901323456096975,12.0,Contact,46.818928915243646,sa3018482,playerId

The right-handed slugger was named New York’s Dominican Summer League Player of the Year that first summer when he finished with a .744 OPS and seven homers across 54 games. His big stateside breakout came in 2024, when he opened with a .262/.338/.444 line and 10 homers in 64 games with Single-A St. Lucie. That prompted a late-June promotion to High-A Brooklyn, but Baez lasted only eight games with the Cyclones before suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee that required season-ending surgery. He returned to the South Atlantic League for 2025 before being dealt to the Cardinals in the Ryan Helsley deal at the Trade Deadline. Baez’s power blossomed in 2024 as he managed a 104.6 mph 90th-percentile exit velocity, among the Florida State League’s best at just 19 years old. It’s stout strength from his 5-foot-10 frame, and it helps that he can pull and lift the ball with authority. He’ll shorten his movements with two strikes, going from an open stance and leg kick to a more stationary load and doesn’t whiff much against any pitch type. He does chase a good amount, however, and he hits a ton of popups at this stage of his development, leading to a low BABIP. The infielder will clock occasional solid home-to-first times, but he isn’t expected to be much of a runner as his body matures. Baez got looks at shortstop, third base and second before the trade but remains likely to slide to the hot corner long-term, where his hands and arm strength are solid fits. He gives the Cardinals another dynamic infield talent alongside JJ Wetherholt and Yairo Padilla.

He cracked 10 homers with a 15.7 degree launch, 16.2% K% and 123 wRC+ in 64 games at Single-A, and then he snuck in 8 games at High-A where he proved everything will transfer with 1 homer, a 15.6% K% and a 119 wRC+. He’s not a huge tools guy at 5’10”, but he’s powerfully built and he surely has a powerful righty swing with a 89.7 MPH EV. He’s not particularly projectable and the plate approach isn’t great, so it might be someone who sees his production drop, or maintain, as he gets to higher levels, rather than someone who just keeps on improving. I think a reasonable upside projection for him would be an above average hit/power combo, rather than a truly special one. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 71/24/79/.263/.321/.441/7",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7631578947368421,0.6973684210526315,0.4868421052631579,0.6710526315789473,0.8289473684210527,68.45,66.66666666666667,,,53.69649805447471,2,0.5,50.23562472978816,62.07496865542586,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.0888889000000006,75.06666680000001,55.0,67.52999061662777,22.0,Contact,53.101829137482504,sa3018507,playerId

He was a standout at the Dominican and Arizona complexes in '22 and 2023 respectively, and jumped to Single-A Visalia for the first time at just 18 years old during the latter season. He returned to the California League for ’24 and slashed .265/.337/.414 with seven homers and 20 steals in 109 games. He was one of only of five players aged 19 or younger to get at least 500 plate appearances in Single-A last season. It's still very much a projection game with Luis. The switch-hitter evened out his splits in '24 after looking better from the left side earlier in his career, and at a listed 6 feet, 170 pounds, there’s still the expectation that he’ll grow into average power, even if it didn’t quite show up in the hitter-friendly Cal League. His chase rate also drastically improved between his two trips to Single-A, but it still remained relatively high against all pitch types in ’24 and particularly on changeups. Luis is an above-average runner who will press for 20+ steals, even if he slows down a little with extra bulk. The D-backs rotated him between shortstop, third base and second base because of their low-level infield depth, but the lion’s share of his looks came at the six. His average arm strength might still make him a better fit at the keystone long term, but he could be valuable there as a split-resistant hitter with some pop, even if the OBPs never truly stand out.

He’s a pretty explosive player at 6’0”, 170 pounds with plenty of room to add more raw power down the line, but he’s still raw in most aspects of his game. He needs to refine the hit tool, plate approach, base stealing, unlocking more game power and defense. It’s a lot, but simply hitting the ball harder would cure a lot of ills and he should naturally hit the ball harder as he ages. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/16/62/.265/.321/.403/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7105263157894737,0.5394736842105263,0.7105263157894737,0.9342105263157895,0.9078947368421053,72.76,50.0,,,31.1284046692607,2,0.5,33.14283398184176,58.89399189364462,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.1166666999999997,75.4000004,55.0,68.99619762809338,22.0,Contact,53.828289012642024,sa3018508,playerId

He had a good showing in the Dominican Summer League that season and followed the Jackson Chourio path by skipping the stateside complex with a move to Single-A Carolina for 2023, hitting .285/.379/.354 in 70 games. After a late-season run with High-A Wisconsin, he headed back to the Midwest League for the duration of the 2024 season and stumbled offensively with a .245/.332/.327 line, four homers and 45 steals in 110 games. He got in 25 more games in the Arizona Fall League to make up for time lost to a right-hand injury. A switch-hitter, Lara shows solid bat-to-ball skills from both sides of the dish but expands the zone a bit more as a right-handed hitter, though he's done a better job of that with Double-A Biloxi in 2025. He lacks meaningful power in his 5-foot-8 frame and may never push for double-digit homers. Because of that, Brewers coaches have pushed Lara to focus on improving his line-drive rate in hopes of getting more balls off the ground and into the gaps, where he can use his plus speed to pick up extra bases. Those wheels make Lara an impressive center fielder, and while roster needs pushed him to right field in the AFL, his plus arm strength made him a good defensive fit out there as well. Lara’s athleticism gives him a good floor as a fourth outfielder who can put the ball in play, and he’ll still only be 20 years old for the duration of the 2025 season. But the lack of impact will always limit his ceiling.

It was good for a 151 wRC+. He’s a bit of a tweener age wise with his birthday smack dab in the middle of baseball season, so while I wouldn’t say he was old for the level, he was on the older side, and when he got the call to Single-A, the numbers dropped off hard with 0 homers, a 73 wRC+ and a 29.8% K% in 23 games. It’s fair to give him an adjustment period to full season ball, so I don’t want to be too hard on him for that. It does underscore the risk in his profile, namely the hit tool risk, but his power/speed combo is legit, and that is what I love to chase in fantasy. He’s high risk, high reward.

Their faith in his bat has allowed them to challenge him with assignments as the youngest regular (age 18) in the Single-A Carolina League in 2023 and the second-youngest batting qualifier (age 19) in the High-A Midwest League last summer. His .245/.310/.336 line in the MWL belies his offensive upside and testifies to his need to add strength. A right-handed hitter, Rojas recognizes pitches than most players his age and makes consistent contact with a quick yet controlled stroke. He uses the entire field and improved his ability to drive balls in the air in 2024. Once he gains more muscle and learns to turn on more pitches, he should develop average or better power. Rojas features average speed with good instincts on the bases. He'll need to maintain his quickness to remain at shortstop, though the Cubs think he will, and he has a strong arm capable of making accurate throws from a variety of angles. He also has seen some action at second base and acquitted himself well there.

He hit 6 homers with 21 steals (in 29 attempts) and a 88 wRC+ in 96 games at High-A. We have to grade on a curve because he was young for the level, and the 15.3% K% was excellent, so it’s not like it was a terrible year or anything, it just displayed that he’s a better real life prospect than a fantasy one. He can play SS and he gets the ball on the ball, which gives him a very high floor, but the power/speed combo projects to be moderate at best. He’s a solid fantasy prospect, but not a truly coveted one at the moment. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 78/17/71/.273/.326/.421/15",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6330275229357798,0.6605504587155964,0.5779816513761468,0.5963302752293578,0.7614678899082569,63.89,88.88888888888889,75.0,92.6829268292683,54.47470817120623,4,1.0,73.94080910653464,67.40778318728712,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.7527778000000005,95.0333336,85.0,69.61683499618614,12.0,Contact,65.53424246828376,sa3018571,playerId

He caught the attention of Detroit's Major League staff the following spring and got off to a solid start with Single-A Lakeland in 2024 before a PCL sprain in his right knee caused him to miss more than three months. The left-handed slugger made up for the lost at-bats in the Arizona Fall League and won the circuit’s Triple Crown with a .433 average, 10 homers and 27 RBIs, while also leading it with an .867 slugging percentage, 1.376 OPS, 17 extra-base hits and 78 total bases. Briceño’s injury was both poorly timed and may have oddly benefitted him in the long run. Playing in the Florida State League at just 19, he posted consistently high exit velocities, thanks to his size and strength, while pounding pitches inside the zone. His full-season numbers could have been quite the sight. On the other hand, Tigers officials note that he used the time off from the injury to get more athletic, specifically in his lower half, and that allowed him to take off in the AFL. His power, combined with his barrel control, could lead to strong offensive numbers as he continues to climb the ladder. His defense remains an open question. Briceño was considered below average behind the dish before the injury, and to protect the knee, the Tigers kept him out of the squat with time at first base in Lakeland and Arizona. He’s still rough around the edges at the cold corner, where many believe he’ll eventually land full-time. But Briceño’s offensive gains have caught the attention of scouts across the industry and make him a must-follow in 2025.

Both of their hypes have grown considerably since then, and if not for a knee sprain knocking out 2 and a half months of Briceno’s season, his hype could have been even more. But he’s making up for lost time right now in the AFL, winning the MVP award with 10 homers and a 1.376 OPS in 25 games.

The second cousin of former NBA guards Stephon Marbury and Sebastian Telfair, he was born in Brooklyn before moving to the Dominican Republic and signing from there for $397,500 in 2022. He slashed .268/.404/.405 with 10 homers between two Class A stops at age 19 last year, leading the system in on-base percentage and posting a 136 wRC+ as the second-youngest regular in the High-A Midwest League during the second half. Few teenagers can match De Paula's combination of swing decisions and exit velocities. He smoked balls harder than ever in 2024 as he began to fill out his 6-foot-3 frame during offseason workouts with Elly De La Cruz and Juan Soto. He recognizes pitches well and has a sweet left-handed stroke, enabling him to control the strike zone and make hard contact to all fields. He made progress with his ability to pull and lift pitches last season and could grow into at least 30-homer power as he continues to improve and get stronger. De Paula could become a slightly smaller version of Yordan Alvarez, but the Dodgers hope he'll provide some baserunning and defensive value. He has fringy speed but showed the savvy to steal 27 bases in 30 attempts in 2024, though those numbers will diminish as he faces better competition. His instincts on the outfield corners are only rudimentary and the club is challenging him to improve defensively. He's still learning to make the most of his average-to-solid arm strength.

He might have the best hit/approach/power combo of all of them, putting up a 19.8/17.5 K%/BB% with a 130 wRC+ in 107 games split between Single-A and High-A. His game power still hasn’t exploded, but it ticked up from 2023 with 10 homers (2 homers in 2023), and he hits the ball so hard at 6’3” that there is little doubt about his power potential. He doesn’t sell out for power, and his groundball and pull rates are fine, so he has the potential to be one of those special monster triple-slash middle of the order mashers. He’s not a burner, but he went 27 for 30 on the bases, so the guy is obviously a good athlete who knows how to steal a base. He’s not a good defensive player, but with his potentially elite bat, I’m not scared off by that.

After two solid Complex-level seasons in the D.R. and Florida, Suero opened 2024 with Single-A St. Lucie and was promoted to High-A Brooklyn after only 25 games, having slashed .265/.390/.434 with a 141 wRC+. He continued to be productive in the South Atlantic League with a .228/.353/.350 line in 87 games to round out his age-20 season. A little undersized at 5-foot-11, Suero stands out more for his surprising athleticism. He’s at least an above-average runner, flashing plus times out of the box from the right side, and he stole 20 bags across both stops in 2024, fifth-most among Minor League catchers. He was relatively new to catching when he signed, and Suero focused mostly back there in his first two seasons but expanded his defensive resume to first base and left field last year. That has carried into 2025 at Brooklyn and Double-A Binghamton. Suero runs a simple operation as a hitter, looking calm before unleashing an uppercut swing. That helps him elevate on contact, aiding his pullside power but also leading to a good amount of harmless popups. He chased less at High-A than Single-A but whiffed more against soft stuff. It’s an OBP-driven hitting profile for now, but if he can play multiple premium positions at a high level, his future will only get brighter.

He was again an on-base fiend in the Florida Complex League in 2023, and that was enough for the Mets to acquire him that July in a deal for David Robertson. Vargas got a little time at Single-A late in 2023 and was set to take on full-season ball for a longer stretch but was limited to only 37 games because of various bouts with wrist tendinitis. The left-handed hitter slashed just .208/.369/.238 over 168 plate appearances in his age-19 season, but the wrist problems basically made that campaign a wash. When Vargas did play, he continued to display the advanced approach at the plate that excited New York officials in the first place, and his 20.2 percent walk rate was ninth-best among 499 Single-A hitters with at least 100 PA. His already below-average power was sapped by the wrist problem, and it didn’t exactly return during his run at High-A in 2025. Vargas has fringy speed but has shown solid baserunning acumen to this early point in his career. He split his time between shortstop and second base in 2024 with some time at third mixed in, and he’s likely a better fit at second, where he could be above average if he sticks there. He might be best served as an OBP-driven middle-infield option off the bench.

That was first evident in the Dominican Summer League, where he batted .333 with a .465 OBP over 50 games in '22, and he pushed through the Arizona Complex League after hitting .320 with a 9/21 K/BB ratio across 26 games a year later. After a dip with Single-A Visalia in the second half of ’23, Torin returned to the California League for all of last season and finished with a .255/.381/.344 line with four homers, 15 steals and almost as many walks (81) as strikeouts (84) across 108 games. There were 46 players aged 19 or younger to reach the qualifying standard at Single-A in 2024, and Torin ranked among the top six in on-base percentage, walk rate (15.8 percent), strikeout rate (16.4), hits (107) and total walks. As expected for those numbers, the right-handed hitter doesn’t expand the zone much and rarely misses when he does swing, staying straight to the ball. That approach has come with limited in-game impact to this point. Torin does lift and pull the ball but prioritizes contact at the detriment of power. Swinging with more intent could help that improve moving forward. D-backs officials note that Torin looked leaner entering ’25. He was just an average runner at best, but his actions and movements -- as well as his quick throws -- on the dirt portend a possible above-average shortstop. He’ll need to improve his consistency, though, as he can occasionally mishandle playable balls. The D-backs have gotten him some time at second base at each stop, but so much depends on Torin’s impact at the plate.

After he gained some strength and made his U.S. debut in late July 2023, teams repeatedly asked about him in trade talks. The White Sox acquired him last July in a three-team swap that sent Erick Fedde and Tommy Pham to the Cardinals and Michael Kopech to Los Angeles. He didn't play after the deal because of a fractured left tibia that required surgery in November. A career .303/.449/.415 hitter in three years at the lowest levels of the Minors, Albertus stands out with his quick right-handed swing, disciplined approach and bat-to-ball skills. He continues to improve at lifting balls in the air and did a better job of using the opposite field last year. The next step will be to add more muscle to his 6-foot-1 frame so he can develop 15-homer power to go with his hitting ability. Though Albertus has below-average speed, his high baseball IQ helps him play a bit faster than that on the bases and in the field. His solid arm strength, reliable hands and lack of quickness make him best suited for third base, where he's a decent defender with the work ethic to become better. He divided his time equally between the hot corner, second base and shortstop in his first two years as a pro, and Chicago plans on giving him a chance to show what he can do in the middle infield.

Arias signed for $4 million out of the Dominican Republic. Wrist and thumb injuries shortened his first two pro seasons, though he was one of the more dynamic players in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League in 2023. He struggled in his first taste of full-season ball, batting .233/.335/.393 with 13 homers and Single-A Florida State League highs in steals (37) and strikeouts (171) last summer. While Arias will work counts and produces plus raw power with his bat speed and growing strength, he also has an overly aggressive, pull-happy approach that leads to many chases and empty swings, including on pitches in the zone. He's a switch-hitter who has a much better stroke from the left side (.776 OPS in 2024, compared to .544 from the right side), and all 22 of his homers in his first three seasons came as a lefty. He still could produce 20 or more homers per season, more than most shortstops, but he has created serious concerns about his bat and ability to make adjustments. A plus runner who's aggressive on the bases, Arias stole 64 bags in his first 183 pro games but needs to improve upon his 75 percent success rate. He has smooth actions and one of the strongest infield arms in the system, but his attention to detail slipped last year as he made 22 errors in 84 games at shortstop. He paled in comparison to Tampa teammate George Lombard Jr. at short and looked better at second base.

There is a lot of inherent risk if you haven’t even hit full season ball yet. Arias struggled to adjust for the first 3+ months of the season with a .652 OPS and 34.9% K%, but he finally found his groove in the final 2 months, giving hope that the big prospect breakout can still happen in 2025. In his final 47 games he slashed .276/.390/.471 with 7 homers, 16 steals, and a 24.4/14.6 K%/BB%. The strikeout rate has been high throughout his career, so there is definitely hit tool risk here, but he hits the ball hard, he has speed and he gets on base. I don’t think it’s fair to expect a truly elite prospect breakout anymore. You are really aiming for those rocket ships with little to no bumps in the road, and that isn’t quite Arias. But just because his stock took a hit, doesn’t mean he’s not a really talented prospect. Just more of a Top 100-150 one. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/20/77/.247/.326/.442/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4189189189189189,0.44594594594594594,0.4189189189189189,0.43243243243243246,0.2432432432432432,40.38,26.086956521739136,,2.777777777777779,69.64980544747081,3,0.75,38.622866501250016,39.76500327543751,1.0,2–4 yr,-0.625,57.5,70.0,42.76350098263126,17.0,Contact,42.19357544218407,sa3019674,playerId

Now his namesake is trying to work his way through the Pirates’ system. Blanco Jr. signed for $900,000 back in January 2022 and since then has shown glimpses of his tremendous offensive potential along with what he needs to work on, spending two years in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League and then making progress in his first taste of playing in the United States, with a .890 OPS in 30 Florida Complex League games, but that came to an end with a hamstring injury in July. Blanco is a monster of a human now standing at 6-foot-7 and more than 240 pounds. With that frame comes an absurd amount of raw power, huge exit velocities and leverage. But that's only when he makes contact, something that has been an issue in his early career. The good news is he cut his strikeout rate by about 10 percent in 2024, leading to better numbers overall. He's always going to be power-over-hit, and the Pirates will live with some swing-and-miss, knowing that if he can even find the barrel at a fringy rate, he's going to put up big power numbers. More than anything for his development, Blanco has to stay on the field so he can get reps in order to refine his approach. He worked this offseason on his conditioning to enhance the odds of him staying healthy. Playing a corner outfield spot still isn't completely out of the realm of possibility, but he'll be getting a lot more time at first to keep his bat in the lineup.

Signed for $2.05 million out of Venezuela by the Phillies in 2022, his son has a very similar profile. Traded to the White Sox for Tanner Banks last July, he won the High-A South Atlantic League batting title by slashing .300/.359/.381 with 27 steals in 89 games in High-A between the two organizations. Bergolla has a compact left-handed stroke and focuses on putting the ball in play, ranking seventh in the Minors in swinging strike percentage (4 percent) and eighth in strikeout rate (11 percent) last year. He generates extremely low exit velocities and a lot of opposite-field grounders, and he'll need to get a lot stronger and change his swing and approach to ever produce much power. He homered just once in 168 games and slugged .354 in his first three pro seasons. Growing up around the game, Bergolla developed a high baseball IQ that adds to his value as a runner and defender. He has plus speed and swiped 27 bases in 33 attempts last year after going 4-for-8 in his first two pro seasons.

That changed this year with him stealing 27 bags in 33 attempts at High-A. He combined that with a 10.6/8.1 K%/BB%, a .300 BA and a 114 wRC+ in 89 games as a 19 year old. He truly has special contact ability. There is absolutely zero power in here with 1 homer in his entire 168 game career, and he’s a small guy without much raw power, so he isn’t going to grow into much more either. It’s likely a utility infielder profile, but those contact rates are elite, and if he hits his way into the lineup, he should steal enough bases with it to be interesting for fantasy. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 73/7/38/.283/.332/.371/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,95,0.5412844036697247,0.06422018348623854,0.6100917431192661,0.3394495412844037,0.981651376146789,48.25,31.25,,,18.67704280155642,2,0.5,20.32840872243839,38.47744305285344,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.2111112000000013,88.53333440000002,55.0,51.36073307585603,22.0,Contact,48.518996764135224,sa3019777,playerId

He showed off his power-speed combination in his first full season, finishing a home run shy of a 20/20 campaign despite missing a month with a quad injury. He spent the 2024 season with High-A Greensboro trying to make adjustments to his approach and setup at the plate with some success that didn’t necessarily translate to his stat line, and he again landed on the injured list, this time with a left shoulder issue. After he struck out in 30 percent of his plate appearances in 2023, Brannigan focused on cutting down the swing-and-miss, mostly by lowering his attack angle. He was way too steep in the zone and flattened his bat path, resulting in a 26.1 percent K rate in 2024. He did trade some power while working on contact, but given his strength and bat speed, there’s hope he can put the two together and still get to plenty of that pop without the strikeouts piling up. A tremendous athlete who can steal a base, Brannigan could be an easily plus defender at third base, the spot he played in college. Because of his range, instincts and an arm that touched the upper 90s as a reliever, the Pirates wanted to see what it looked like at shortstop, and it turns out it looks pretty good. If he can stay committed to his swing changes, he could take off this year, while profiling as a toolsy everyday shortstop who might be 24 for the 2025 season, but is young in terms of professional reps.

Odds are the hit tool isn’t going to be good enough to be an MLB starter, bit if he can make real improvements to the hit tool, the upside is high enough for him to make an impact. Think something like a Luke Raley type career arc, where he breaks out when he’s in his late 20’s, but you’re still not quite sure if he truly has a lock on a full time job. And like Raley, Brannigan has that type of power/speed combo with 18 homers and 12 steals in 77 games. He can lift and pull, he can hit the ball hard, he’s a good athlete, and he has a decent infield glove too. He fits nicely into that reasonably priced, high upside bucket of prospect where you don’t have to wait 5 years to see what you have. You will know pretty quickly into 2025 once he hits the upper minors. I’m kinda liking him the more I’m thinking about him during this blurb, but the odds are still that he won’t hit enough, a la Joey Wiemer. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/18/66/.228/.311/.431/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3577981651376147,0.5596330275229358,0.3577981651376147,0.41284403669724773,0.1834862385321101,38.67,27.586206896551722,,,37.54863813229572,2,0.5,28.38798134979203,35.071293472427215,1.0,1–2 yr,0.369444399999999,45.56666720000001,55.0,38.62488812172817,25.69444399999999,Contact,33.64036649477768,sa3019922,playerId

He put up a 29.4% K% at Florida at 20 year old, before improving that to 22.3% in his age 21 season. He put up a 37.5% K% at Double-A in 2023, and then improved that in 2024 with a 29.9% K%. And then he got to Triple-A this year where he put up a 40.8% K% in 30 games, but we know how this story goes, and I’m expecting that to come down in 2025. Just how far down he can get it down against MLB pitching is the ultimate question, and while it seems likely he will never be able to get it down quite enough, the power/speed/defense trifecta is good enough to roster him in medium to deeper leagues on the off chance he can. He jacked out 20 homers with 16 steals in 128 games, and he put up a 117 wRC+ at Double-A. He’ll compete with Beavers and Bradfield for bench at bats/next man up status in 2025, and while my money is one Beavers or Bradfield, don’t completely count out Fabian. – 2025 Projection: 11/3/16/.210/.289/.389/2 Prime Projection: 55/18/53/.228/.309/.429/11",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2777777777777778,0.5416666666666666,0.3611111111111111,0.2361111111111111,0.13888888888888884,33.07,,,,29.182879377431902,1,0.25,22.61673151750972,29.411356031128403,1.0,0–1 yr,-1.1750000000000007,64.10000000000001,40.0,36.62690680933852,27.0,Contact,33.25210806420234,sa3019942,playerId

He jumped more firmly on the prospect map with a solid first full season across two levels of A ball (17 homers combined), then finishing up with a decent showing in the Arizona Fall League. His forward momentum was stopped by Tommy John surgery in February, though he did return and struggle at the end of the year in Double-A. He got some more at-bats back in the AFL. A 6-foot-4 switch-hitter, McCabe has long had a solid approach at the plate, with excellent pitch recognition skills and the willingness to take walks. He drew free passes even during his rough Double-A debut last year and enters the 2025 season with a 15.2 percent walk rate in his career. He’s a better hitter left-handed, though when he’s locked in, he’s shown he can drive the ball from both sides. He has a more open stance from that side compared to his right-handed setup, and he’s tamed his leg kick a bit. Primarily a first baseman in college, the Braves were giving McCabe a lot of reps across the diamond at third because of his arm strength. With his elbow 100 percent, he should get time at both infield corners moving forward, with that positional flexibility perhaps his ticket to a big league role unless his power profile takes a step in the right direction.

His combination of size, athleticism and power landed him in 2022's first round, where he signed for $2,880,800. He has totaled 33 homers and 68 steals in two full pro seasons but ranked second in the Minors with 200 strikeouts in 2024. With his bat speed and the strength and leverage in his 6-foot-6, 235-pound frame, Jones creates well-above-average power and upper-end exit velocities. But his naturally long left-handed swing makes him late on a lot of pitches and resulted in a 40 percent swing-and-miss rate in 2024, including even more alarming empty contact rates on all fastballs (36 percent) and in-zone heaters (33 percent). The Yankees are working with him on adjustments that would keep his bat on a more level plane and in the zone longer. An average runner out of the batter's box, the long-striding Jones has solid-to-plus speed once he gets going and offers 25/25 upside. After playing right field for the Commodores, he has transitioned to center as a pro and displays average range and arm strength there. He has a better chance of staying in center than fellow tooled-up Yankees outfielder prospect Jasson Domínguez, but Jones' bat is much more of a question mark.

I like to live in the Grey (not Grey as in Razzball Grey, that would just be odd, but Grey as in the Queen’s English of gray), so while I’m obviously less than enthused with Jones’ 36.8% K% in 122 games at Double-A, I don’t want to just banish him to purgatory. His talent is just too huge to do that at 6’6”, 235 pounds with an at least plus power/speed combo. And even with all of the strikeouts, he still showed out in the upper minors with 17 homers, 25 steals, and a 124 wRC+. He doesn’t have to bring the K rate down to like the mid 20’s, he can survive in the low 30’s. Jones isn’t Elly, but we saw the season Elly just put up with a 31.3% K%. The extremely high K rate rate definitely hurts his value (at least he’s no Elijah Green and his 44% K%), but I don’t think it means you should write him off. The upside is too high, and I don’t think the hit tool is hopeless.

Your bat needs to be bulletproof. But he still displayed a solid hit/power combo with 18 homers and a 18.2/9.3 K%/BB%. He can lift and pull, so he’ll get the most out of his above average raw power, and there is opportunity in Miami.

But it came to a screeching halt when Cross slashed just .203/.298/.378 primarily at High-A in ‘23, a disappointing year caused by a variety of issues, including a serious tick-borne illness called Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever that zapped Cross’ strength and ended his season. He was still dealing with slight effects by the time the ‘24 season kicked off, but he got back on track with a .261/.342/.428 slash line and 15 home runs in 101 games at Double-A. In college, Cross had a strong contact ability and was highly regarded for his command of the strike zone but he got away from that a bit and struck out at a 24.1% clip with a 10.3% walk rate in 2024. Cross’ up-the-middle approach has the best impact, and the Royals have really emphasized the direction of his swing to be more forward and linear, which allows him to have better space to get to pitches and find the strength in his left-handed swing. He was able to eliminate some of the swing-and-miss with breaking balls last year but needs to keep working on that approach and game planning. That’s especially true against lefties to avoid becoming a platoon player. Cross is an average runner but possesses baserunning instincts and feel that make him a stolen base threat, and he swiped 30 bags in 32 attempts in ‘24. A solid defender with good jumps in the outfield, Cross has an above-average arm but lacks the true speed needed in center field. The Royals might have him continue to play all three outfield spots for now, though he profiles best in right. Cross needed that bounce-back season in ‘24 but has seen his stock slip with a return to Northwest Arkansas this summer.

It was good for a 115 wRC+. It certainly has his value back on the rise, and while this isn’t the player many were hoping to see after getting selected 9th overall, there is still an intriguing power/speed combo in here for fantasy. He doesn’t smash the ball, but the raw power is solid, and he knows how to lift and pull it. He’s not a burner, but he has speed, and he’s been an excellent base stealer throughout his career, going 30 for 32 this year. The two biggest issues are that the hit tool is below average, and KC is absolutely death (dead last) for lefty homers. It seems like a recipe for a low BA and limited homers. If Cross played in a different park, I might be enticed by the profile, but in KC, I’m a little worried it’s going to be lackluster. 2025 Projection: 19/5/24/.221/.298/.391/7 Prime Projection: 74/18/76/.242/.318/.421/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3486238532110092,0.8165137614678899,0.1743119266055046,0.7798165137614679,0.24770642201834858,45.61,17.85714285714286,46.15384615384615,28.57142857142857,65.95330739299611,4,1.0,43.372119126010176,44.82674169410356,1.0,1–2 yr,0.4472221999999988,44.633333600000014,85.0,45.228522548231076,16.472221999999988,Power,43.808668566703986,sa3019985,playerId

He put up a 17.8/7.3 K%/BB% in 56 games at mostly Double-A, and while he didn’t perform that well with a 96 wRC+, 3 homers and 4 steals (in 8 attempts), he was playing much better before an oblique injury, followed by a trade to the Nationals, and then followed by a broken rib interrupted his season. It’s a mostly low launch, all fields approach, and while he can nab a few bags, he doesn’t have big speed, so even if he can find full time at bats, it’s a low upside fantasy profile. – 2025 Projection: 16/2/19/.236/.288/.372/2 Prime Projection: 51/13/56/.255/.317/.414/7",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5045871559633027,0.5688073394495413,0.3486238532110092,0.5321100917431193,0.37614678899082565,47.13,,,28.260869565217394,32.68482490272373,2,0.5,26.653992556251055,39.963397394687874,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.036111200000000565,50.43333440000001,55.0,45.47551937840636,22.0,Contact,38.25065060028287,sa3019996,playerId

Signed for $3,531,200, he progressed a level per season and spent 2025 at Triple-A. The A's declined to protect him on their 40-man roster afterward, and the Twins selected him in the Rule 5 Draft before dealing him to the Giants for fellow catching prospect Miguel Caraballo. Susac's best attribute is his plus raw power from the right side of the plate, and he has done a better job of tapping into it by pulling and lifting more pitches during the last two seasons. Though he has posted respectable numbers in the Minors, there are questions about his ability to produce in the Majors because he turns his right-handed stroke loose way too often. After he posted a 41 percent chase rate in 2024, the A's wanted him to cut that down -- and he swung at 40 percent of the pitches he saw outside the zone last season. A former high school quarterback, Susac is deceptively athletic for a 6-foot-4 catcher. He won't be a Gold Glover behind the plate but he's a better defender than he has gotten credit for.

He put up a solid season at Double-A with 12 homers, 7 steals, and a 103 wRC+ in 88 games. It came with a terrible 25.9/4.3 K%/BB%, and while he improved his launch this season, he’s still not a huge launch guy.

Thompson was thought to be one of the best pure hitters in the college game at the time and has shown glimpses of living up to that billing as a pro. Though he missed a chunk of his first full season with an elbow injury, he still made it to Double-A and turned in a strong Arizona Fall League performance in 2023. That didn’t carry over to the start of his 2024 season back in Hartford, but there were encouraging signs in the second half. The Rockies think the adjustments Thompson made as the season went on bode well for him reaching his offensive ceiling. He still has a smooth left-handed swing and is capable of using the whole field, hitting the ball hard for extra bases. He’s had a little difficulty keeping weight on his 6-foot-3 frame, but he showed up in Arizona after his offseason more physical, which should help him get to a little more power. Because he trusts his feel to hit so much, he sometimes isn’t patient enough and increased discipline could allow him to get more pitches to drive. The hardest thing to figure out has been where Thompson could play defensively. He’s seen time at third, second and first on the dirt, but he may have finally found a home in left field, looking more athletic than he has anywhere on the infield. Removing defensive stress could also help him unlock his offensive potential, with the knowledge it’s the bat they were buying in the first place.

He's a 5-foot-8 catcher with solid speed who started games at five different positions over the past two seasons. The Giants acquired him in a trade for Kai-Wei Teng in January. Despite his lack of physicality, Villarroel packs surprising strength in his compact frame and has a quick right-handed swing that generates higher exit velocities than most players his age. He could produce 15-20 homers per season once he adds more muscle and starts driving balls in the air more regularly. He has decent plate discipline though he can get pull-happy and roll over grounders to the left side. If Villarroel remains at catcher, the physical demands of the position will take a toll on his offensive production as well as his quickness. He has solid arm strength but will need time to polish his receiving, blocking and throwing. He also has seen action at every other position besides shortstop and pitcher.

Houston signed Clifford for roughly second-round money with a $1,256,130 bonus and saw him get off to a hot start in his first full season with 18 homers and a .919 OPS in 83 games between Single-A and High-A. He was promptly dealt alongside Drew Gilbert to the Mets at the Trade Deadline for Justin Verlander and slowed down at pitcher-friendly High-A Brooklyn. The Mets got Clifford out of Coney Island quickly in 2024, and the lefty slugger produced a .231/.359/.456 line with 18 homers in 98 games for Double-A Binghamton to close out his age-20 campaign. On one hand, Clifford was one of only five hitters aged 20 or younger to meet the qualifying standard at Double-A in 2024, and his 133 wRC+ only trailed Roman Anthony's 143 and Samuel Basallo's 134 in that group. He has plus power and gets to it well with an uphill bat path that helps him lift and pull. On the downside, while Clifford typically runs a healthy walk rate, he continues to have trouble making contact against softer stuff, leading to his status as a king of the three true outcomes. After struggling against righties in 2024, his splits have switched to more traditional ones in 2025 back in Binghamton. Clifford is also a below-average runner, and even though he has the arm strength for outfield corners, the majority of his starts continue to be at first base. His power would play there, but it’d be helpful if he can be more than a homer-walk-strikeout type. That said, Clifford is pushing for a Major League debut by his age-22 season of 2026.

He jacked out 18 homers with a 133 wRC+ and 28.9/15.6 K%/BB% in 98 games. Even at High-A he put up a 124 wRC+, which is the sign of a good player who can still produce when the homers aren’t coming (or it’s a sign that High-A pitchers just didn’t want to pitch to him with a 23.5% BB%). Clifford was one of my favorite targets in his first year player draft class because he looked like a sure bet to become an exciting power hitting prospect, and that is exactly what he’s become. The strikeouts are too high to really put him into that elite tier, but I wouldn’t rule out him improving there at a still young 21 years old. Even if he can’t, the power will play on any level. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/31/90/.239/.324/.491/4",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8472222222222222,0.9444444444444444,0.5833333333333334,0.7916666666666666,0.3472222222222222,73.83,81.4814814814815,83.33333333333334,,84.63035019455253,3,0.75,77.0735315310733,74.96523603587565,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.988888899999999,97.86666679999999,70.0,77.77607083076269,17.0,Power+OBP,66.02256523384322,sa3020126,playerId

Lou Collier’s kid took home Futures Game MVP honors with a big home run and finished second in the Midwest League with 20 long balls in 2024. While Collier’s offensive production has been a little inconsistent, including his '24 season with Dayton, he started showing he has the ability to get to his considerable raw power. He has impressive bat speed from the left side of the plate with the ability to hit the ball out of the park to all fields. There’s some swing-and-miss in his game, but he draws walks and he continued to provide more loft in '24, continuing a trend from late in '23 when his ground-ball rate started to shrink. Collier has more than enough arm to play third base and he’s shown some ability to be able to man the hot corner, but he’s a below-average runner with a thick frame, so many think he’s going to have to move across the diamond to first. He got some time there during instructional league play last fall and could see time at both corners so he can keep working on his athleticism and perhaps even provide multiple avenues to get his power bat into a big league lineup in the future.

Age to level production, EV, pedigree, approach, eye test, great eventual home ballpark … Collier has a ton of things going for him, and he really gets barely any hype. There is definitely hit tool risk, but that often comes with the package for young power hitters. Don’t underrate Collier. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/29/93/.252/.333/.486/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7889908256880734,0.3211009174311927,0.926605504587156,0.555045871559633,0.23853211009174313,61.44,82.75862068965517,50.0,,84.43579766536965,3,0.75,68.27825944546609,63.833390805913126,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.3222223,89.8666676,70.0,66.42201738177394,17.0,OBP,59.313241341798275,sa3020131,playerId

The Texas native zoomed through the New York system in his first full season, thanks to a .263/.425/.451 line, 13 homers, 104 walks and 45 steals in 121 games across three levels, including Double-A Binghamton. He returned to the Eastern League to begin 2024 but suffered right wrist discomfort in April and underwent debridement surgery in June. He returned to Minor League play in late August, got a quick cameo with Triple-A Syracuse and made up for the lost at-bats in the Arizona Fall League. After a healthier 2025, Williams was moved to the Brewers in the offseason as part of the return for Freddy Peralta and Tobias Myers. The injury and limited sample make it easy to set aside Williams’ age-20 season, but much of his scouting report remains the same. Standing 5-foot-7, the former Mississippi State commit doesn’t give pitchers a huge zone, and he doesn’t much expand it either, leading to solid walk rates and OBPs. He can work long at-bats, though sometimes those result in strikeouts too. The right-handed batter utilizes a leg kick in his load, and he tends to elevate the ball on contact, enabling him to get to average power despite his frame. True to his first name, Williams can burn quickly out of the box, and he proved to be more aggressive and efficient in steals in the Fall League once he was further away from the wrist issue. Drafted as a shortstop, he split his time between there and center field in the AFL and also saw some time at second base in the late summer. Williams still profiles anywhere up the middle, and it’s no shock that Milwaukee, which values such talents highly, sought him out in a blockbuster.

He underwent surgery on his right wrist just 11 games into the season and he didn’t return until the end of the August. Wrist injuries are known killers for hitters, so it’s not surprising to see he wasn’t great after returning from the injury either with 0 homers and a .656 OPS in 33 games on the season. I would call it a completely lost year, but if there is one small silver lining to take out of it, it’s that he was actually really good in his final 6 games at Triple-A. He had a 192 wRC+ with a 89.6 MPH EV. I know it’s just 6 games, but it shows how the 5’6” Jett can truly pack a punch. He also proved the GB rates (around a 32% GB%) and the plate approach (23.6/14.9 K%/BB%) won’t fall apart in the upper minors. Also keep in mind he was just 20 years old this year. Lift, speed, plate approach, and sneaky pop is a potent fantasy combination, and with Williams’ injury induced down year, I’m sensing some major buy low opportunities this winter. This is an electric player, size be damned. – 2025 Projection: 16/2/10/.238/.305/.385/5 Prime Projection: 96/19/66/.264/.345/.438/32",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.875,0.7361111111111112,0.7361111111111112,0.75,0.48611111111111116,74.71,92.5925925925926,77.77777777777779,,89.49416342412452,3,0.75,80.43751006671582,76.71462852335053,1.0,0–1 yr,-4.274999999999999,100.0,70.0,79.10488855700515,17.0,Power+OBP,67.04719985065232,sa3020134,playerId

Central High School in 2022 but signed for sixth-round money at $282,500. He put himself on the map with a strong first full season for Single-A Carolina, winning Carolina League All-Star honors with a .233/.400/.401 line, 11 homers and 30 steals in 99 games. Playing in his age-20 season last year, Adams put up remarkably similar numbers (.227/.443/.397, 11 HR, 28 SB) in 101 games with High-A Wisconsin and helped push the Timber Rattlers to an appearance in the Midwest League Championship Series. Standing at 6-foot-4, the right-handed slugger makes for a sight in the box with high hands and an interesting leg kick that leads into an extended front side. There is good raw power in Adams’ frame, but he doesn’t play as well into it yet because of high groundball and infield popup rates. The Brewers hope to add more verticality to his swing to get the elevation needed for better pop. But for now, Adams can still scare pitchers away from pitching in the zone (or in some cases into him with an astounding 40 hit-by-pitches in ’24), and while he can be too passive early in counts, that approach has worked to his benefit to this point. Adams has been willing to push the envelope on the basepaths but will likely settle into below-average speed as he matures. He can make it work at third base despite rough actions at times, but he's made the move to first base in 2025. The power and aggression will have to come around more, even as he comfortably clears the offensive standard for every league he's played in.

He conquered High-A in 2024 with a 154 wRC+, 11 homers, 28 steals and a 21.3/18.7 K%/BB% in 101 games. While there is a lot to like, you can pretty easily build a case against him too. He still hasn’t fully tapped into that raw power, he’s not a true burner and he gets caught stealing a solid amount (10 CS), and the hit tool has been pretty bad with a .227 BA in 2024 and .233 BA in 2023. It’s not hard to see this profile start to fall apart a bit when he gets to the upper minors, and then ultimately the majors. That is why seeing him prove it at Double-A in 2025 is going to be a big step, and only then can his hype really explode into Top 100 prospect range. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 81/20/76/.252/.333/.441/14",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9541284403669725,0.8853211009174312,0.9908256880733946,0.8073394495412844,0.5137614678899083,87.07,67.85714285714286,85.71428571428572,,73.15175097276266,3,0.75,69.64267321714678,80.97043562600136,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.75,83.0,70.0,84.62963068780041,17.0,Power+OBP,66.13333380951019,sa3020135,playerId

He was a backup catcher at Vanderbilt during the Commodores’ run to the 2019 College World Series, spent most of his time at first base in 2020-21 and worked evenly at both spots during his senior season in ’22. The Yankees selected him in the 19th round of the 2021 Draft, and the Rays were intrigued enough by his offensive and defensive upside to spend a fourth-round pick (and a $397,500 bonus) on him a year later. Since his 2021 breakthrough at Vandy, Keegan has consistently hit. The idea of having a catcher with his natural hitting ability is intriguing, especially for a club like the Rays that has often been starved for offense behind the plate. He has an easy right-handed swing, with decent power to all fields. The Rays pushed him to Double-A in 2024 after only 48 games in High-A the year before, and he responded by batting .285/.371/.435. He’s consistently pushed decent walk rates but has seen his strikeout rate jump this season at Triple-A Durham. He’s not necessarily a star hitter, but what he can do at the plate as a catcher is still his strength. There are still concerns about Keegan’s defensive ability, and one wonders if a team like the Rays -- who have often prioritized defense behind the plate to the detriment of their lineup -- will ever count on him as a frontline catcher. But he is smart and cerebral, a good game-caller and a roughly average defender overall who’s shown continual improvement with the desire for more. His framing in some parts of the zone, including his glove side, could stand to improve. He has a strong arm but not necessarily a shutdown cannon, leading to low caught-stealing rates over multiple years now. At worst, he has a big league future as an offensive-minded catcher.

He made his upper minors debut in 2024 and didn’t blink with a 138 wRC+, 9 homers, and a 20.4/11.3 K%/BB% in 104 games. His upside isn’t huge as he’s more of a complete hitter than one who sells out for power, but he’s got more raw power in the tank if he ever decides to try to unleash it. He’s not known as a particularly great defender, but he’s improving, and Tampa’s Catcher depth chart is horrendous, even after the Danny Jansen signing, so beggars can’t be choosers.

Along with third-rounder Alan Roden, that’s got a chance to be a fine Draft class for Toronto. Kasevich got his feet wet at Single-A that season, then jumped to High-A in ‘23 where he posted a .284/.363/.365 line. In ‘24, he opened at Double-A and eventually jumped to Triple-A with a combined line of .296/.348/.385. Kasevich is an organizational favorite, from coaches to the development staff. You’ll hear the word “machine” a lot, and some coaches have even noticed older players gravitating towards Kasevich, given how he handles his business. Prospects younger than Kasevich have tried to emulate him, too, which is one of the highest forms of praise. Another extremely intelligent young prospect, Kasevich is also one of the strongest defensive shortstops in the organization with tremendous body control while fielding. He’ll still see the odd game at third base, but the Blue Jays fully believe in Kasevich as a shortstop long-term, betting heavily on both his mental and physical games. At the dish, contact is Kasevich’s identity. His 10 home runs in 247 career Minor League games don’t paint much of a power hitter, but that’s not his game. If Kasevich can drive the ball more consistently, sneaking a few more balls through the infield while turning some singles into doubles, that should be enough to make his bat play at the MLB level. If that happens, Kasevich’s defense will help his case, and his intangibles could take him over the top. A stress reaction in his lower back has kept Kasevich from pushing through the Minors' top level in 2025.

And unlike some other fringy prospects on the Jays, his glove might actually get him on the field. The hit tool is damn good with a 11.8% K% and .296 BA in 128 games in the upper minors. He put up an 89.6 MPH EV at Triple-A, which is pretty good, and he was 13 for 14 on the bases with solid speed. The deeper the league, the more value he will have, but if the hit tool transfers to the majors, he could end up having value in most league sizes. – 2025 Projection: 9/1/10/.259/.305/.357/2 Prime Projection: 73/9/58/.276/.323/.382/11",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.041666666666666664,0.013888888888888888,0.3472222222222222,0.027777777777777776,0.9166666666666666,21.47,54.16666666666667,,73.33333333333334,10.700389105058361,3,0.75,34.887056852572414,26.16596989840034,0.68,0–1 yr,-1.4805555999999989,67.76666719999999,62.0,29.8232910495201,25.0,Contact,35.62381441228404,sa3020203,playerId

Even with that stupid strikeout rate, he still slashed .262/.342/.487 with 9 homers, 25 steals (only one caught stealing), and a 41.4/10.4 K%/BB% in his last 51 games. I don’t even want to do that whole “if he can improve his hit tool” spiel because I couldn’t even do it while keeping a straight face with that dumb stupid strikeout rate, but on the say 5-10% chance he can get that strikeout rate into the 30-35% range by his mid 20’s, there is dangerous power/speed combo lurking in here to do the rest at an uber athletic 6’3′, 225 pounds. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 59/21/72/.221/.302/.418/17",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6216216216216216,0.7432432432432432,0.35135135135135137,0.6216216216216216,0.013513513513513487,50.99,,,0.0,63.22957198443579,2,0.5,37.6215953307393,46.311058365758754,1.0,2–4 yr,0.13888880000000015,48.3333344,55.0,49.18781766972763,23.388888,Contact,39.29285163137743,sa3020210,playerId

But in both years, he gained momentum down the stretch and earned a promotion up a level. So while a career .239 average heading into 2025 isn’t exactly what people projected, he did make it to Double-A at age 20 in his second full season before going on to the Arizona Fall League and Team USA in the Premier12 Tournament. Small, compact and strong, Johnson is a left-handed hitter with elite pitch recognition skills. His 186 combined walks in 2023 and 2024 are second among all Minor Leaguers and while he swung and missed more than expected out of the gate, he’s largely kept the strikeouts in check. Johnson has impressive bat speed and the chance to get to even more power, but he needs to trust his all-fields approach more. He’ll get too big at times with his leg kick and hand movement, trying to put the ball 20 rows deep to his pull side. At his best, he can send line drives to the left side. The more he can trust that his power will come naturally, the better all-around hitter he can become. While the consensus continues to be that Johnson is best suited for second base long-term, he’ll continue to get reps at shortstop to challenge him and keep him athletic. The Pirates are still bullish on his offensive upside given his age and those underlying traits, with the hope that more reps at the upper levels will help unlock all of that potential.

But Johnson was never just a hit tool only guy, he has real power and speed, so while the hit tool troubles prevent him from rising to near elite prospect status as hoped, it doesn’t prevent him from still being a really exciting prospect. He swings an electric and powerful lefty bat that hits the ball really hard, resulting in 15 homers in 124 games, and his speed has always been a bit undersold, nabbing 22 bags. The hit tool isn’t as good as hoped, but the 21.3% K% isn’t bad at all, and he put up a 19.3% in 14 games when he got the call to Double-A as a 20 year old, which is exciting to see. He’s also an on base machine with a 15.6% BB%. With him falling out of favor in the mainstream, now is a really good opportunity to buy low if you can, because when he produces in the upper minors as a still 20 year old, the hype is going to hit all over again. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 88/23/78/.262/.343/.452/15",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6972477064220184,0.3486238532110092,0.7614678899082569,0.5229357798165137,0.6605504587155964,60.72,79.3103448275862,76.47058823529412,,92.02334630350195,3,0.75,77.43164604299979,66.56907611504992,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.880555600000001,84.56666720000001,70.0,66.05172291451498,17.0,OBP,58.08660875153175,sa3020214,playerId

The younger brother of former college softball sensations Sierra and Sydney Romero, Mikey signed for a well-below-slot $2.3 million as the 24th overall pick. Persistent back issues that included a stress fracture limited him to 34 games in his first full pro season and sidelined him until mid-May in 2024, but he finally got healthy afterward and hit his way to Double-A at age 21. Romero earned acclaim as one of the best hitters in the 2022 high school class by focusing on making contact from gap to gap with a quick left-handed stroke. He showed an entirely different approach last year, relinquishing control of the strike zone while aggressively looking to launch balls to his pull side. He has added about 20 pounds since turning pro and become more of a power-over-hit guy with some opposite-field thump on occasion. Romero's high IQ helps his tools play up on the bases and in the middle infield. He's an average runner who's more likely to take an extra base than steal one.

He had 10 homers in 59 games at High-A. The reason he has been ignored is because he doesn’t have big raw power, he doesn’t have speed (1 steal all season), and his hit tool/plate approach isn’t particularly good either with a 21.9/5.0 K%/BB% in 60 games overall. Those deficiencies still make me pretty lackluster on his future potential, but production matters, and the guy is no doubt producing while being super young for the level. Maybe he can lift and pull his way into like Connor Norby type territory.” … He closed out the season at Double-A with 6 homers and a 33.8/2.7 K%/BB% in 16 games. That K rate is scary, but he was just 20 years old getting a taste of the upper minors. It was much better at High-A with a 21% K%. He’s getting no love, but the guy was picked 24th overall, he reached Double-A by 20 and showed he can do damage against upper minors pitching. I don’t think he’s a major dynasty asset either, but show the guy just a little bit of love, will ya. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 66/17/71/.245/.303/.412/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5416666666666666,0.8611111111111112,0.1111111111111111,0.7638888888888888,0.29166666666666663,51.36,80.76923076923077,31.25,,19.06614785992218,3,0.75,37.737779394158146,46.59222278795535,1.0,0–1 yr,-4.466666700000001,100.0,70.0,57.22566683638661,17.0,Power,57.20155007637398,sa3020216,playerId

He jumped on the prospect map in 2023 with a performance that allowed him to reach High-A in his first full season. He wasn’t able to build off of that in 2024 as he missed three months with hamstring injuries, though he did return to action at the end of the regular season and made up for some lost reps by competing in the Arizona Fall League. While Rincon’s overall numbers as a pro don’t jump off the page (a career .711 OPS heading into 2025), he does bring some solid offensive traits to the table the Phillies are hoping he can get back to with a clean slate. The switch hitter makes a ton of contact with low miss and chase rates, and he draws a lot of walks. The hope is with continued added strength and healthy legs under him, he can provide enough contact and on-base skills to fit regularly into a big league lineup. What will get him to the big leagues -- and gives him a very high floor -- is his defensive ability at shortstop. He has excellent hands, footwork and plenty of arm for the premium position, and thanks to his instincts, he’ll have more than enough range, especially the further removed from those hamstring issues he gets. He may always be a glove-first guy, but he’s one who could do it as a starter in the future.

Carl's kid has lived up to billing, reaching Double-A in 2024 at age 20, hitting, getting on base and stealing bags at every stop. A two-time Futures Game performer, Crawford capped off his 2024 season by playing for Team USA in the Premier12 tournament. In his two full years of pro ball, Crawford has made a ton of contact and gotten on base at a very high clip. That's led to a career .316 average and .371 on-base percentage with a strikeout rate of 18.6 percent heading into the 2025 season. The left-handed hitter has started to answer questions about his ability to impact the baseball, registering more consistently high exit velocities, and while he still has a high groundball rate, that number has dropped from year to year. He may never have a ton of power, but as he keeps adding strength, he should be able to drive and lift the ball for extra bases more frequently. The work Crawford has done to strengthen his lower half has helped him not play as low to the ground, standing more upright in the box to help on that front as well. More strength also helps Crawford to be more explosive in terms of his baserunning and in his first step covering ground in the outfield. He spent a lot of time working on his defense, and there's still confidence he'll be able to play center field for a long time as he attacks the upper levels of the Phillies system.

He was even better at Double-A than he was at High-A with a 140 wRC+ in 40 games. He has double plus speed, he hits the ball hard, and he has a good feel to hit. It’s pure talent baby, but if he doesn’t start to refine his game, it will eventually catch up to him. He has an extreme 61% GB% and he chases a ton. Good defense and good pitchers, which he will find in the majors, are better able to take advantage of that than minor leaguers. But if he can start to refine his game, and at only 21 years old, I don’t see why he wouldn’t, watch the hell out. The upside is a legit elite dynasty asset, and while I wouldn’t bet on him reaching that lofty ceiling, he can be a game changing fantasy player with even a moderately good outcome. I think there is too much focus on his deficiencies, and not enough focus on what he does well.

Coffey reached High-A Greenville in his first full season and returned to the Drive for a powerful opening to his 2024 season in which he homered 14 times in only 61 games. The Sox moved him to the Blue Jays at that year’s Trade Deadline in a swap for Danny Jansen, and after struggling in his first taste of Vancouver, Coffey has returned to the Northwest League with better results in his age-21 season. Batting from the right side, Coffey stands tall and holds his hands high in his stance before starting his load with a leg kick. He generates good bat speed, leading to solid exit velocities, and he should have enough pop in his bat to regularly push for 12-15 homers each season. That said, he has been especially vulnerable to breaking stuff low and away from his upright stance, and that could be a problem as he faces tougher sliders in the upper levels. Coffey is a solid runner for his size, and using that throwing ability from his days on the mound, he possesses one of the best arms in the Blue Jays' system. Because of the presence of Arjun Nimmala, his days as a shortstop are mostly past him with his time being split between second and third. He’s a better fit at the hot corner with that arm, but if he can get the most of his tools, he could have a future as a utility infielder who provides some thump off the bench.

High School product was a fourth-round pick of the Mets in 2022 but signed for $775,000, well above the $507,700 assigned to the slot. He made the investment look prudent with a solid turn in Single-A in his first full season as he ranked third in the FSL with a .412 OBP. He saw time late in the campaign in High-A Brooklyn and was set to return there in 2024 when a hamstring injury caused him to miss the first half of the season. He rehabbed in Florida and didn’t join the Cyclones until July 31. He had subpar results in the small sample but made up for the lost time with a .208/.371/.359 line and two homers over 17 games in the Arizona Fall League. It's easy to disregard Reimer’s season given the lost time, but at least his main strength continued to ring true regardless of the hamstring. He walked more times than he struck out in both the Minors and the AFL as he continued to show strong swing decisions and a near-elite ability to make contact on pitches inside the zone. He's significantly improved the quality of that contact this season, slugging .502 back in Brooklyn before heading to Double-A Binghamton. Reimer is hitting his stride in his age-21 season. His below-average speed caused him to move from shortstop as a prepster to third base as a pro, and after seeing ample reps at first base in 2023, he moved to left field part-time in the Fall League. He's improved enough defensively in '25 to prolong his stay on the dirt, boosting his stock further. Last Prospect 3 Jonah Tong Next Prospect 5 A.J.

He comes from a baseball family and actually impressed scouts just as much on the mound in high school, but the Royals have only had him hit in the three years since he was drafted. Charles improved upon repeating Single-A in 2024, slashing .257/.353/.386 with 10 homers, 15 doubles and 36 stolen bases in 117 games. Charles is an extreme athlete with tons of tools, including a plus arm and raw power. He’s tall at 6-foot-5, which doesn’t help his hit tool, but he made some adjustments with his swing this year, getting his hands to load back for a better firing position. The goal is to eliminate some of the length in his swing, helping him make better contact on fastballs and walk more. He still struggles with offspeed, but a tweak in his game planning helped him with his recognition and win counts. Finding stability in his swing will allow him to tap into his raw power. Charles’ frame doesn’t make him your typical shortstop, but he has good movements and a strong internal clock that helps him handle the position, while also getting time at third base in Columbia in ‘24. He’s an average runner, but quick-twitch movements help him on the bases. After two seasons in Single-A, Charles made significant progress but really struggled with a move to High-A in 2025 while also dealing with injuries. He is only in his age-21 season and still has untapped potential with his tools and athleticism, but the Royals are excited about what it all could look like if he turns things around as he develops.

He was 20 years old and repeating Single-A, which is never a great sign, and while he had a much better season this year with a 121 wRC+, the .257/.353/.386 triple slash with a 25.8% K% and 10 homers in 117 games doesn’t exactly look great. You only have to watch him swing the bat once with an insanely athletic, quick, and powerful righty swing to overlook the lackluster statistical profile, and he can certainly lift and pull it with a 35.2% GB% and 60.1% Pull%, so he should be able to get to most of his power down the line. He also has plus speed with 36 steals. The real question is the hit tool, and while it seems the odds are against him hitting enough to be a full time regular, the upside would be considerable if he can figure it out. He continues to hover in that Top 200-ish area for me as a high risk, high reward lotto ticket. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 69/18/74/.233/.308/.423/19",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.06578947368421052,0.2236842105263158,0.02631578947368421,0.17105263157894737,0.26315789473684215,13.12,0.0,,39.28571428571429,51.94552529182879,3,0.75,29.6910088938299,18.919853112840464,1.0,2–4 yr,-0.8027778000000012,59.633333600000014,70.0,21.83695597385214,17.0,Contact,33.20329690823347,sa3020497,playerId

That proved true when the first baseman slugged 19 homers and finished with a .916 OPS in 102 games between Single-A and High-A in his first full season. Isaac got off to another quick start in 2024, slashing .287/.381/.535 with 15 homers in 71 games back at High-A, but struggled after an August promotion to Double-A Montgomery, where he posted a 40.6 percent K rate. Isaac got some extra at-bats in the hitter-friendly Arizona Fall League to end on a brighter note. The left-handed slugger truly pops from a power standpoint already through his age-20 season. There is strength in his hacks leading to loud exit velocities routinely above 95 mph and occasionally above 110, and there’s an uppercut swing that turns that contact into extra-base hits. It’s the main driver of Isaac’s profile. But evaluators were getting more timid about him after he missed on 49.3 percent of his Double-A swings against all pitch types. Isaac started from an open stance in Montgomery but adjusted to be more straight-forward in the AFL, perhaps in search of less movement, and that’ll deserve monitoring. The Rays are also working with him on pitch selection to help him find the barrel more often. Isaac has improved his agility ever since joining the Tampa Bay system while maintaining his prodigious strength, and he’s become a better runner, base stealer and fielder as a result. The Rays tried him out in right field -- keeping him on the same side of the diamond -- and plan to continue that at the upper levels, especially as Isaac shares rosters with Tre’ Morgan. Isaac was exclusive to DH in 2025 as he initially worked through elbow and wrist issues, and in the offseason, he revealed he underwent ""life-saving"" brain surgery in July.

He looked like a potential star in summer showcases, became Gatorade’s Georgia High School Player of the Year in 2022 and helped Wesleyan (Norcross) win the Georgia Class A private school state title. The D-backs selected him second overall that July and signed him to a franchise-record $8,189,400 bonus. His first tastes of the pros were marred by shoulder, quad and hamstring injuries, and he returned to Single-A Visalia for 2024, slashing .275/.409/.405 with six homers and 21 steals in 109 games. It's been a process getting Jones going offensively. He didn’t chase as much in his second bite at the California League apple, but he also didn’t swing much either -- only Juan Soto (36.9 percent) had a lower swing rate in the Majors than Jones’ at Single-A (38.0). When he did decide to hack, it was too often on the ground and to the opposite field, dulling the above-average raw power he exhibited as an amateur. D-backs coaches are working with Jones on improving the directionality of his swing while not sacrificing contact after he still whiffed on his share of sliders. Entering his age-21 season, Jones remains a special defender in center field, one who can track balls down with plus-plus speed and make tremendous snags when needed. His plus arm strength is another weapon. The typical caution about all development not being linear applies, but Jones will need to start showing more growth at the plate to come close to his cathedral-high ceiling. After a bumpy start to 2025, he started to show mid-season adjustments -- namely calming some of his preswing movements -- that have allowed his natural power to play a little better with High-A Hillsboro.

He went back to Single-A and slashed .275/.409/.405 with 6 homers, 21 steals, and a 28.0/18.0 K%/BB% in 109 games. It was good for a 125 wRC+. The strikeout rate is way to high for a 20 year old at Single-A, and so is the 57.2% GB%. Even with a .409 OBP, he still only stole 21 bags in 26 attempts, and with speed now looking like the main selling point here, that really isn’t that impressive. All of the raw tools and bloodlines that got him drafted so highly are still there at a projectable 6’4”, 180 pounds with a plus raw power/speed combo, but he still looks so raw out there. He needs to refine his game in every aspect (other than defense, where he is a plus CF, which will help get him on the field for sure). Right now he looks on track to be more of a mid 20’s breakout candidate, which isn’t what you want when you draft a high schooler 2nd overall, but that is where we are at.

They signed him for $4.35 million, the third-highest bonus in that cycle, with one scout comparing him to a smaller version of Gary Sheffield. Expectations have been revised downward after he hit .282/.370/.326 with 19 steals in 35 games during his U.S. debut in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League last summer. A right-handed hitter with a reputation for advanced bat-to-ball skills, Mayea struggles with pitch recognition and often is off balance when he makes contact. That flaw produces a lot of soft grounders and reduces his impact, not letting him take advantage of his bat speed and projectable strength. He used his quickness to beat out a lot of infield hits in the FCL, something that won't be as easy to do against better defenses. Mayea's best tool is his plus speed, which allows him to create havoc on the bases and chase down balls in center field. He's a solid defender who can become better than that if he can refine his reads and routes. His strong arm is an asset anywhere in the outfield and notched nine assists in his first 66 pro starts.

After a solid first full season, he seemed poised to make a big leap to the upper levels following a stint in the Arizona Fall League, but a torn thumb ligament limited him to just 68 games in 2024 with Double-A Reading, though he did make a return engagement in the AFL. A 6-foot-3 left-handed hitter, Rincones has the frame, strength and capacity to be a good hitter with plenty of power. But while he did hit 11 homers in his shortened season with Reading last year, he still has a hit-first mentality at the plate. His metrics are solid, with good exit velocities and walk rates, and he rarely chases, giving him the chance to hit at the next level. The key will be for him to find ways to tap into his natural strength without sacrificing any of that hit tool. Rincones’ baserunning abilities have perhaps been undersold in the past. He’s far from a burner, but despite getting very low run grades, he’s been an instinctual basestealer, with 55 steals over his two full seasons, and he takes great pride in impacting the game that way. He’s an acceptable defender in an outfield corner and he’s close to knocking on the door; if the power starts to show up more consistently, he could be a regular at the big league level.

He’s not a burner, so don’t expect big steal totals in the bigs, but he should at least be a contributor in the category.

San Diego continued to push the backstop with stops at High-A Fort Wayne and Double-A San Antonio before a right knee sprain ended his year early. He returned to the Midwest League for 2024 and remained there all season, finishing with just a .206/.288/.311 line and four homers in 111 games. He showed some improvements from August onward (109 wRC+ in the month) and held his own in the Arizona Fall League. In July, Salas traveled to San Diego to work with Padres Major League hitting coaches and started standing taller in the box. The adjustment helped him stay more square to the ball rather than getting under pitches for catchable fly balls, and he became more proficient at producing extra-base hits (11 of his 27 doubles on the season came in August). His strikeout and walk rates were still within healthy margins, but some evaluators would still like to see the quality of contact return for a larger sample. While the bat perplexes, Salas' defensive work remains a major strength. Sticking with one team all season enabled him to become even better at working with pitchers and forming game plans, and his blocking and receiving earned strong marks for a High-A backstop. He also improved at limiting the running game in '24 after focusing more on efficiency than quickness with his throws. He's a fine example of the phrase ""development isn't always linear,"" and that's continuing into 2025 as he's missed most of the season with a stress reaction in his back.

The only thing that matters is if he’s developing to be an impact major league player down the line, so it’s even too early to say it was a mistake. He slashed .206/.288/.311 with 4 homers, 10 steals, and a 20.9/10.0 K%/BB% in 111 games. The strong K/BB rate is important, because it shows he wasn’t completely overmatched or anything. He was also a bit better towards the end of the season with a .723 OPS in his final 28 games, which he’s carried over into the AFL with a .751 OPS in 23 games. And he hit really well in 2023 at Single-A, so he does have a track record to look at to not be overly concerned about this year. He’s an excellent defensive catcher who will have no problems sticking behind the dish, and that will also juice up his trade value as he ranks extremely high on real life lists. Catchers get downgraded in fantasy in general, and while I do still like his bat a lot, there is a question about exactly how high his offensive upside is. I would value him as a really good prospect, but not an elite one. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/24/85/.269/.342/.468/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1926605504587156,0.05504587155963303,0.6880733944954128,0.01834862385321101,0.908256880733945,34.17,100.0,100.0,100.0,85.99221789883269,4,1.0,95.09727626459144,55.49454669260701,0.22,1–2 yr,-4.852777799999998,100.0,65.5,50.4418640077821,31.5,OBP,51.07383880350195,sa3020881,playerId

His raw tools were on display during his debut in the Dominican Summer League after signing, and he played well in the Florida Complex League to kick off his United States debut in 2024, though a bump up to full-season Augusta did not go well. Guanipa is an aggressive right-handed hitter who has shown off excellent bat speed and the ability to make loud contact at times. He swings at just about everything and chases too much, leading to a bit more swing-and-miss when he moved up a level (25.7 percent strikeout rate in 32 games with Augusta). It’s looking more like he’s not going to have that much power, so he’ll have to refine his approach and be a contact-oriented hit-over-pop type to succeed. While there might be questions about his bat, there’s confidence about Guanipa’s speed and defense. He should run well enough to be a threat on the basepaths and he has the chance to be at least an above-average defender in center field. He’s just 19 for all of 2025, with time to reach the ceiling expected of someone so highly regarded on the amateur market, with some seeing a bit of a Manuel Margot profile in him.

He played well in the age appropriate stateside rookie ball with 2 homers, 4 steals, a 12.3% K% and 112 wRC+ in 20 games, but he struggled hard when he got the ball to Single-A with a 42 wRC+ in 32 games. The 25.7/8.1 K%/BB% shows he wasn’t completely lost, and at only 18 years old with very little pro experience, I wouldn’t kill him too much for struggling there. Plus speed and potentially plus CF defense are his best two attributes right now, and he’s starting to lock in at least a pretty good feel for contact. Contact, defense and speed is a pretty safe profile that also has fantasy upside. How much power he gets to is the ultimate question, and while he’s an explosive player, he’s not a big guy and he hit the ball on the ground a decent amount this year. He wasn’t that to the moon prospect we hoped for, but there is still a nice little combination of floor and upside in here.

Duno came in at No. 4 and joined the Reds with a bonus of $3.1 million. He’s shown ability on both sides of the ball, though injuries have slowed down his development. An elbow issue limited him to DH duties in the Dominican Summer League right after signing, though he finished with a .944 OPS. The Reds moved him aggressively to full-season Daytona for 2024 and he was holding his own when a broken rib ended his season at the end of May. Once again healthy, Duno hopes to show what he can do over the course of a full season. He’s a big, strong right-handed hitter with outstanding bat speed and plus raw power. He has an idea of what he’s doing at the plate, with a willingness to take walks, though the strikeout rate climbed during his time in the Florida State League and his swing can get a bit long. Duno can show off a plus arm from behind the plate and he’s pretty athletic given his 6-foot-2 frame, something he’ll have to manage as he matures so he can continue to block and receive well. The Reds don’t have a catcher ahead of him in the system to block him, so he’ll dictate his own pace. The first order of business is to have a full, healthy campaign in his age-19 season.

And really everyone loved this kid as a hyped up international signing who destroyed the DSL and most certainly looks the part at 6’2”, 210 pounds. Not only did he hold his own at the level, but he thrived with a 127 wRC+, 10.5% Barrel%, 89 MPH EV, and a 19 degree launch. He only hit 3 homers in 32 games, but that clearly isn’t indicative of his true talent level. And he only played in 32 games because his season ended in late May with a broken rib. There is hit tool risk with a 28.8% K%, but considering how young he was the level, I’m not overly concerned with that. He’s an elite power hitting catcher prospect waiting to happen, and he has the type of true upside to go after this off-season. I’ve been calling him a target since his signing year, and now is certainly the time to strike even in shallower leagues. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 74/28/82/.251/.338/.487/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,1.0,0.9594594594594594,1.0,0.9594594594594594,0.7972972972972973,95.95,96.55172413793103,91.66666666666666,,76.65369649805447,3,0.75,80.4025142527157,90.5083799884505,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.9527777999999998,73.4333336,70.0,90.94001403653516,17.0,Power+OBP,67.05967303644083,sa3021066,playerId

He also won a pair of championships in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer and Arizona Complex Leagues the past two years, homering three times in 10 playoff contests. A switch-hitter early in his amateur career, Vargas now bats solely from the right side of the plate with a quick, compact stroke that produces a lot of hard contact. He has a lot of leverage and room to gain strength in his 6-foot-3 frame, and he improved his ability to drive ball in the air consistently in 2024. He could provide 25 or more homers per season, though his strikeout rate rose from 15 percent in his first pro season to 23 percent in his second, so he'll have to prove he can do damage against more advanced pitching. Bigger than most shortstops, Vargas has average speed and good instincts on the bases, though he could slow down as he continues to add muscle. He has good actions and plenty of arm for shortstop, though his range could be an issue if he loses any quickness.

He had a strong year in stateside rookie ball with a 129 wRC+, but 4 homers in 38 games shows the game power isn’t quite there yet, the 22.8% K% is on the high side, and he wasn’t that successful on the bases, going 11 for 16. So that means he still needs to improve his hit tool, power, and speed. Completely reasonable for an 18 year old rookie baller to need to improve basically everywhere, and I still love the power upside at a projectable 6’4” with hard hit ability, but it’s not quite that straight rocket ship you really want. He’s a Top 100 prospect for me, but I can’t put him in that truly coveted tier quite yet. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 81/25/85/.257/.336/.465/8",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1891891891891892,0.7972972972972973,0.12162162162162163,0.6621621621621622,0.16216216216216217,36.61,59.25925925925925,35.29411764705882,,80.35019455252919,3,0.75,56.32805164231456,43.5113180748101,0.592,2–4 yr,-1.7888889,71.4666668,59.8,43.90889544244303,27.200000000000003,Contact,41.93233630909937,sa3021067,playerId

He has done nothing to dispel that notion, beginning his pro career by reaching High-A during his pro debut at age 17. He earned South Atlantic League all-star honors at that level last year, leading the circuit in triples (nine), extra-base hits (50) and total bases (192) while batting .261/.342/.443 as its youngest regular (age 18), then dominated in a five-game cameo at Double-A. The right-handed hitter has thrived against significantly older competition in his first two years as a pro, displaying exceptional bat speed and the ability to produce elite exit velocities for his age. He has no trouble driving balls in the air to his pull side, creates plenty of leverage with his still-projectable 6-foot-4 frame and earns top-of-the-scale grades for his raw power from some evaluators. He has the hand-eye coordination for solid bat-to-ball skills but he's extremely aggressive at the plate and struck out at a 26 percent clip in 2024, so he may need to tone down his approach at higher levels. Walcott can flash plus speed and has basestealing ability, but he's more of a solid runner who could slow a bit as he matures physically. While he needs to get more consistent with his hands, footwork and throwing accuracy, he does have smooth infield actions for his size and a rocket arm. If he winds up outgrowing shortstop or lacking the dependability for the position, he'd profile well at third base or right field.

He’s then been that rocket ship prospect you hope for, culminating with him putting up a 172 wRC+ at Double-A as an 18 year old … granted it came in 5 games with a 29.2/4.2 K%/BB%, but I felt it would be more dramatic to leave that part out. And what he did at Double-A was more or less meaningless when he was already over 4 years younger than the average player at High-A, where he slashed .261/.342/.443 with 10 homers, 26 steals, and a 25.5/10.6 K%/BB% in 116 games. It was good for a 123 wRC+. It can be harder to evaluate players when they are so much younger than the level, but there was actually a similarly talented 18 year old at High-A all season with Walcott, Ethan Salas, and Salas put up a 75 wRC+ for comparison. The elite dynasty asset potential is clear with a potentially plus to double plus power/speed combo, but he’s not quite there yet. The hit tool is still a risk and the K rates have been high at every stop. He also hasn’t fully tapped into his raw power yet with relatively low flyball rates (although he pulls the ball over 50%). I wouldn’t quite place him in the truly elite prospect tier, but he’s in the one right under that.

He made his U.S. debut last summer, leading the Rookie-level Florida Complex League in walks (51 in 52 games), runs (44) and steals (37) before scuffling after a promotion to Single-A at age 18. The Marlins acquired him and outfield speedster Emaarion Boyd in a December trade for Jesús Luzardo. Some evaluators believe that Caba is the top defender in the Minors and give him top-of-the-scale 80 grades for his shortstop defense. He has smooth actions along with quality range to both sides, solid arm strength and a good internal clock. He's also more consistent than most teenage shortstops and looks like a lock to win Gold Gloves when he reaches the big leagues. A switch-hitter, Caba has a patient approach at the plate and focuses on making contact to all fields. He understands that his role is to get on base and make use of his plus speed and basestealing acumen. He lacks strength and has a flat stroke from both sides of the plate, so there are questions about his ability to do damage and he may not produce more than 10-12 homers per season.

He signed with the Rays for $3.7 million in January 2023, and they viewed him as a top five prospect in that amateur class -- arguably the most exciting international player they’d landed in years. But he played in only seven games in the Dominican Summer League that year before needing season-ending shoulder surgery to repair a torn right labrum, then he only played 28 games in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League last summer before shoulder issues once again forced him off the field. The physical tools are all still there for Guerrero, which is reflected in his ranking. He’s built like a middle linebacker, with strength and physicality well beyond his 18 years. It’s easy to look at him and see the middle-of-the-order slugger the Rays imagined when scouts Danny Santana and Remmy Hernandez signed him out of the Dominican Republic. He generates elite bat speed, some of the best in the Rays organization, and produces big-time power with exit velocities reaching into the 110 mph range. He’s a well-rounded hitter, too, with a smooth swing and a good feel for the strike zone. Guerrero split time between center and right field in 2024 and has continued that trend in Single-A Charleston in 2025, but he’s bound to land in a corner-outfield spot eventually. He’s fast enough, with plenty of arm strength, to capably handle right field. The Rays were impressed by his makeup and work ethic when they signed him, and it’s likely he’d be rocketing up lists like this if he’d been healthy the past two years. But he needs to play a full season without getting hurt to prove himself, and knee injuries in 2025 haven't helped that case.

But he showed enough in those 28 games to take on the added injury risk. He’s a big and physical 6’1”, 215 pounds with a vicious lefty swing that smokes the ball. He slashed .330/.452/.466 with 2 homers, 13 steals, and a 25.4/17.5 K%/BB%. He’s not a burner, but he’s a good athlete, and he signed for $3.7 million in 2023, which tells you the type of talent he has. He hit the ball on the ground too much (50%), he struck out too much, and there is injury risk, but there is also big upside in here. The shoulder injuries are really just creating a larger buy window here than there should be. And he’ll still be just 18 years old for half of 2025, so there is plenty of time for development. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 76/26/87/.257/.326/.469/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8648648648648649,0.7837837837837838,0.5675675675675675,0.8108108108108109,0.21621621621621623,69.03,43.47826086956522,,,68.67704280155642,2,0.5,49.450917780409405,62.177321223143295,0.888,2–4 yr,-2.419444500000001,79.03333400000001,52.2,68.47469646694299,24.8,Contact,53.34028021012435,sa3021072,playerId

His son Rayner was one of the most physical players in the 2023 international class and signed for $2,697,500 out of the Dominican Republic amid comparisons to Eloy Jiménez. He has played just 41 games in two Rookie leagues in his first two years as a pro, with his debut cut short when he broke his left wrist diving for a fly ball and his second season delayed when he sprained the same wrist in the same manner. A right-handed hitter, Arias offers an exciting combination of hitting ability, power potential and plate discipline. He's bigger and stronger and possesses more bat speed than most teenagers, and he's able to drive balls in the air to his pull side without compromising his ability to make contact. His wrist injuries have cost him a bit of strength because he hasn't been able to keep up with his weight lifting, but the hope is that he'll be back to 100 percent and upper-end exit velocities in 2026. Arias developed a high baseball IQ while growing up around the game, which enhances his average speed on the bases and in the field. He makes good reads and routes in center field, though he'll have to move to a corner if he loses any quickness as he fills out.

The 25.7% K% was too high, he showed no power and he’s not great on the bases (3 for 6). He’s had some injury issues in his young career (multiple wrist injuries after diving for balls in the OF), and considering the $2.7 million signing bonus at a projectable 6’2”, 185 pounds, some patience is prudent here. The down and injured 2024 has his stock dropping, but I want to give him one more year before really tanking him.

So they’ve been trying to talk in more hushed tones about Calaz, who they signed for $1.7 million at the start of the 2023 signing period. But they’re having a hard time containing their enthusiasm after he posted a .984 OPS during his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League, then hit his way from the Arizona Complex League to full-season Fresno and finished with a combined .344/.446/.633 line last year. That doesn’t mean Calaz -- who will play all of the 2025 season at age 19 -- is a finished product. Far from it, and what amazed the Rockies is that he managed to win the ACL Triple Crown without really having an idea of what he’s doing at the plate yet. Already strong and physical, Calaz hits the ball about as hard as anyone in the system, posting elite-level exit velocities, with tremendous raw power he’s still learning to tap into. He draws walks but still needs to tone down his swing tendencies as he is susceptible to breaking stuff away and out of the zone in particular. The Rockies feel like Calaz is starting to show the makings of being a five-tool player and he’ll continue to get reps in center field. Most feel that his 6-foot-2 frame will continue to fill out and he’ll slow down more, necessitating a full-time move to right field, where his power production should profile perfectly.

He cracked 7 homers in 43 games in the DSL in 2023, he smoked 10 homers in 49 games in stateside rookie in 2024, and then he chipped in 2 homers in 13 games at Single-A to close out the season. He crushes the ball with plus to double plus raw power, and his batted ball profile is conducive to both power and average. He slashed .327/.386/.571 at Single-A as an 18 year old, and has a career .336/.436/.603 triple-slash in 105 career games. He’s done nothing but obliterate every level of pro ball that’s been put in front of him. He doesn’t exactly have my favorite batting stance, but the swing is quick and powerful, and I’m not going to get too caught up in that. The biggest risk is the contact rates, as the strikeout rate has been high at every level (career 23.4% K%, which is quite high for rookie ball levels), culminating with a 28.1% K% at Single-A. We have to trust Colorado to develop him, which isn’t great, and then we have to trust Colorado to actually play him and give him leash, which also isn’t great. Combined with the hit tool risk, it prevents me from going higher than this, but he has one of the top 19 year old power bats in the minors.

He held his own as the youngest regular (age 18) in the Single-A Carolina League last season, slashing .250/.343/.383 with 36 extra-base hits in 110 games. The Red Sox acquired him along with a Competitive Balance Round A Draft pick and a player to be named in exchange for Quinn Priester this April. Rodriguez stands in the box as a 6-foot-1 left-handed hitter and twists slightly in before uncoiling on his swings. One of his standout traits in 2024 was his ability to focus on pitches in the zone, thus limiting chase and producing a healthy walk rate, especially for someone with his limited experience. His power should be average as he catches up to more age-level competition, but the Brewers were working to add a little verticality to his swing to produce more line drives and fly balls that will allow the power to play more. Rodriguez is a solid runner who may lack the speed to stick in center field over the long haul. His arm, which stands out more for its accuracy than its pure strength, would work in right field if needed. The teenager has plenty of developmental runway ahead of him and will get the time and space needed to become a potential well-rounded outfielder.

He won their Latin program player of the year award after hitting .346/.392/.560 in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League in his pro debut. He posted similar numbers in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League last spring, earning a promotion to Single-A at age 18, but he never played at that level because of a broken left hamate. Cespedes earns Howie Kendrick comparisons for his hitting ability and stocky build. With his quick right-handed swing and fine hand-eye coordination, he regularly barrels balls and produces high exit velocities. He already displays the aptitude to launch pitches in the air to his pull side, which could result in 20-homer power. His aggressive approach and ease of contact may mean that he'll need to adjust and lay off more pitches at higher levels. Though Cespedes played mostly shortstop in his first two pro seasons, like Kendrick he's more of a second baseman. He has fringy speed and range at short, and his arm is merely average. He has played mostly at second in 2025 and some scouts wonder if he might wind up as a left fielder in the long run.

He’s a lift and pull machine who takes absolute daddy hacks at the dish with a monster righty swing. He swings much bigger than his 5’8” size would indicate. I’m thinking the contact rates could take a step back in full season ball, but I believe in the power despite not being a huge human being. If the contact rates don’t take a step back, we could be looking at a very potent hit/power combo, and even if they do, he should remain a very good prospect. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/25/84/.268/.329/.458/8",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.40540540540540543,0.7702702702702703,0.13513513513513514,0.6756756756756757,0.6486486486486487,49.3,50.0,0.0,,75.87548638132296,3,0.75,42.50257495994506,46.92090123598077,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.6222223000000007,69.46666760000001,70.0,51.611270510794235,17.0,Contact,48.568405249857406,sa3021085,playerId

His development got off to a rough start when he batted .186 with a .565 OPS over 50 games in the Dominican Summer League in his first season, but he bounced back right out of the gate back in the DSL in 2024, earning a promotion stateside in late June. He continued to pound the ball (.317/.463/.537) during a short stint in the Florida Complex League and even saw Single-A ball for eight games at the end of the season. The right-handed slugger starts from a very open stance and sweeps his lead leg over as part of his load. He was lauded for plus raw power coming into pro ball, and he certainly got that to play with a strong focus on lifting and pulling the ball in the air. He clubbed two homers and 13 doubles in his 37 games, and as he continues to mature, more of those gappers should head over the fence. Gutierrez got that pop to play even more as he made much more contact in year two, tightening his swing to get the barrel on the ball while fanning in only 13.4 percent of his plate appearances (a number that was inflated by his aggressive FSL time). The Caracas native has above-average arm strength, and while his caught-stealing numbers haven’t been great in the early going, they should improve as he works with more veteran arms who can be quicker to the plate themselves. He has the body of a catcher at 5-foot-11 and should get every chance to stick there heading into his 20s.

Signed out of the Dominican Republic, he went 5-for-7 with a homer, triple, five runs and three RBI in his pro debut in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League and hasn't stopped hitting since. He slashed .323/.414/.483 in his first two years as a pro and had no trouble handling Single-A pitching at age 18 in the final six weeks of last season. Francisca has bat speed and tremendous feel from both sides of the plate and makes repeated contact to all fields with ease. He'll chase pitches on occasion but does a good job of working counts and drawing walks for a teenager. Though he's just 5-foot-8 and needs to add strength, he has surprisingly solid raw power and could provide 15-20 homers per season if he learns to drive the ball in the air more regularly. Francisca is a solid runner but will flash plus or better run times on occasion, and he has the instincts and aggressiveness to steal bases. He's a twitchy athlete with smooth actions, range to both sides and reliable hands at shortstop.

He’s not a big guy at 5’8”, so power isn’t expected to be a huge part of his game, but he can definitely pack a punch in that small frame . And keep in mind he will still be just 18 years old at the start of 2025.

He made steady if quiet progress since then as a catcher, culminating in his stateside debut last summer in the Florida Complex League. He had a hot start in the FCL before fading down the stretch, then was putting up moderately improved numbers in a return engagement back at the complex when he was sent to the Twins in the Chris Paddack trade. Jimenez isn’t a big body behind the plate at 5-foot-9 and 170 pounds, and his presence at the plate fits accordingly. He has a good eye for the strike zone, though he can be prone to passiveness as a hitter at times, and makes contact with a quick swing and short levers. Using a slightly open stance, there is some solid raw bat speed and strength for him to tap into in the future. Though he’s had more at-bats hitting left-handed, he’s been more effective in limited at-bats from the right side off southpaws. Defensively, he commands the game and handles pitchers well, and he answered the challenge of the running game in the FCL well by throwing out 33 percent of potential base stealers in his two summers combined. While the Tigers were dealing from an area of depth behind the plate, the Twins have had some difficulty developing backstops in recent years. Jimenez doesn’t offer a huge ceiling, but he does give Minnesota someone with a fairly decent floor as a potential big league backup, even though he’s still far away from reaching that role.

If you want to get a little crazy with the comp, his swing reminds me more than a bit of Francisco Lindor’s, and Rodriguez is basically the same size with the same skillset. Lindor’s power was also undersold as a prospect. But Lindor is obviously the stupid ceiling comp. You can also find utility infielders with similar profiles and size. You get the point. He gets the bat on the ball, he’s 6’0” with room for muscle, he’s a good athlete, and he has a good glove.

So far, he’s moved more rapidly up the ladder than shortstop Felix Morrobel, the top of the Angels’ crop that winter. Flores' ability behind the plate will enable him to keep advancing and he’s shown a little more acumen that could make him an even better prospect than expected. Compact and strong, Flores has shown some ability to drive the ball from the right side. He bested expectations with the bat in full-season ball to start off the 2024 season after skipping over the Arizona Complex League. He’s too aggressive at the plate and can chase too much, especially softer stuff, though he can punish a fastball. What pop he has shown has been to his pull side, and with too high of a ground-ball rate, he could stand to find ways to leverage the ball more in the air. The Angels have felt comfortable moving Flores aggressively and inviting him to big league camp in Spring Training two years in a row -- even though he just turned 19 in February -- because of his defense. His strong arm has thrown out 40 percent of potential basestealers in his pro career to date. He’s turning into an excellent receiver who blocks and calls the game well, looking like he’s going to be a plus overall defender with that plus arm and plus instincts. If he can get his bat close to average, he has the chance to be a standout regular in the big leagues.

He was the best 17-year-old performer in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League in his pro debut, batting .359/.472/.618 and starring in the playoffs as his team won the championship. He won another title last summer in the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League, where he finished second in on-base percentage (.459), runs (49) and steals (29) before struggling following a promotion to Single-A. Quintero is a polished hitter who rarely chases pitches out of the zone and makes consistent contact to all fields. His quick right-handed swing produces high exit velocities for a teenager that could portend 20-homer power, though he'll need to learn to drive balls in the air to his pull side to get there. His patience can border on passivity at times, and his scuffles in Single-A indicate he may need to tweak his approach against better pitching. Quintero features at least plus speed and uses it aggressively, stealing 54 bases in 64 attempts (84 percent) in 132 games over his first two years as a pro. His quickness gives him plenty of range in center field, and he could become a plus defender as he continues to acclimate to his new position. His strong arm enables him to fit anywhere in the outfield and has registered 15 assists in 113 pro starts.

It was good for a 142 wRC+. He struggled when he got the call to Single-A with a 77 wRC+ in 27 games, but it came with a 19.6/16.1 K%/BB%, so it’s not like he was completely overmatched or anything. You have to give these kids time to adjust to a new level. He’s an excellent athlete at 6’0”, 175 pounds with plus speed, hard hit ability, a good feel to hit, and a plus plate approach. The launch is geared for both power and average, and he has a good glove in the OF. This guy basically does everything well on a baseball field, and while there is still plenty of development left to go (being more aggressive at the dish, getting stronger, unlocking more game power, proving it at higher levels), you have to trust the Dodgers to get the most out of him.

He tore up the Dominican Summer League in his pro debut, hitting .344/.417/.644 and topping the Rookie-level circuit with 17 doubles, eight triples, 32 extra-base hits and 116 total bases. He continued to excel when he came to the United States last year, slashing .307/.407/.575 to rank third in the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League in slugging and fourth in OPS (.982). Significantly larger and stronger than his listed 180 pounds suggests, Morel hits balls harder than most teenagers and has plus raw power. He has had less success tapping into it in 2025, when he hasn't launched balls in the air to his pull side as easily and his plate discipline has regressed. His right-handed swing can get too long at times and his aggressive mindset results in strikeouts. Morel draws comparisons to a more athletic version of Marcell Ozuna. He presently has solid speed and looks to make things happen on the bases, though he may slow down if he gets much bigger. His plus arm contributes to his right-field profile, though his defensive instincts and effort need improvement.

Signed for just $50,000 out of Venezuela in 2023, he was arguably that system's best defensive backstop before making his full-season debut. He came to the United States last summer and placed second in walks (45) and third in on-base percentage (.444) in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League. A move to full-season ball in 2025 has been a challenge, but he’ll get the chance to hit the reset button with the Pirates, who acquired him as part of the prospect package in return for David Bednar at the Trade Deadline. Taller and significantly stronger than his listed 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, Perez has the upside of plus receiving and blocking skills. His arm strength already is at that level, and he boosts it with a quick release that helps him shut down the running game. More athletic than most catchers, he's agile behind the plate and shows below-average speed on the bases. Though his defensive prowess stands out the most, Perez has offensive potential as well. A right-handed hitter who's more disciplined than most teenagers, he has the strength to provide 15 homers annually once he learns to launch balls in the air to his pull side more often. His approach can border between patient and passive, but he makes his share of hard-hit contact.

It only came with 2 homers due to a 51.7% GB%, but he hits the ball hard, so there is more game power in the tank if he can raise his launch.

After earning midseason All-Star honors in the Dominican Summer League in 2023, Gonzalez made his stateside debut in ‘24, playing in 41 games in the Arizona Complex League with a .285/.398/.384 slash line, 11 doubles, 22 stolen bases and 110 wRC+. He jumped up to Double-A for four games at the end of the year. Another true center-field prospect in the Royals system, Gonzalez is a plus defender who looks like a natural in center already. He has average-to-a-tick-above-average arm strength that should improve as he grows. He’s 6-foot-2, 170 pounds right now and should be able to add more strength to his tall frame. That might help him find more pop in his bat. He’s more of a contact hitter with good exit velocities, an efficient mover despite his long arms and lankiness. His swing is more slashy with a lot of ground balls, but he does make quality contact -- having only struck out at a 20.3% clip in the ACL -- so there’s belief that the loft can come because of the foundation he has already. Gonzalez is a plus runner who has become more efficient on the basepaths with more reps. Gonzalez might have the highest ceiling of all of the Royals’ center fielders because of his foundation and projection, but he still has a ways to go in his development. He’d be a prototypical leadoff hitter who can be a weapon on the bases and a defensive asset if he puts it all together. He has strong makeup too and has transitioned to full-season ball at Single-A Columbia in 2025.

That perception has changed after he ranked fifth in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League in hitting (.350) during his pro debut, then encored by winning the batting title (.355) and MVP and top prospect awards in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League last summer. He also topped the FCL in on-base percentage (.471), slugging (.584) and OPS (1.055) while stealing 30 bases in 51 games, then held his own as an 18-year-old at Single-A. Arias makes advanced swing decisions for a teenager and repeated contact with a simple right-handed stroke. As they have with several of their top prospects, the Red Sox have helped him add strength and bat speed, and he did a better job of driving balls to his pull side during his U.S. debut. He could hit for average, draw a healthy amount of walks and provide 15-20 homers per year. Arias' tools are fairly similar to Marcelo Mayer's at the same age. He's a fringy runner with a high baseball IQ that enables him to play faster than that on the bases and in the field. He's the best shortstop defender in the system, featuring range to both sides, reliable hands and a strong arm.

They don’t jump off the screen, they don’t have huge size, and they don’t have huge tools, but they are just really good baseball players who do a lot of things well on a baseball field. I like them, and I definitely like them for real life, but they are probably a bit overrated for fantasy. Arias demolished rookie ball with a 181 wRC+ on the back of elite plate skills with a 17.5/16.5 K%/BB% in 51 games. He then got the call to Single-A and wasn’t as impressive, slashing .257/.311/.378 with 3 homers, 5 steals, and a 17.5/9.6 K%/BB% in 36 games. He was only 18, so that is still a very solid line, but I do think it underscores how the production might not look so outsized against more advanced competition. He hit 9 homers in 87 games, so he has some pop, and he stole 35 bags, so a he’s a good baserunner despite not being a burner. An up the middle glove with good contact rates and some power and speed is a really high floor real life profile, but we play fantasy, and we want upside.

He batted .289/.412/.555 in Rookie ball during his first two pro seasons, ranking fourth in the Dominican Summer League with 10 homers in his debut and third in the Arizona Complex League with eight blasts last year. Though he's listed at 5-foot-8 and 160 pounds, he produces some of the best exit velocities in the system. After showing a more measured approach in the DSL, Mogollon adopted a leg kick and focused almost solely on launching balls in the air to his pull side in 2024. With his quick right-handed stroke, he still smoked balls hard and hit some tape-measure shots, but he also posted the third-highest strikeout rate in the ACL at 38 percent. He's not afraid to work deep counts and take walks, and he does show some feel for the barrel when he's not trying to do too much at the plate, but he'll have to tone down his aggressiveness when he faces better pitching. A plus runner with savvy on the bases, Mogollon stole 16 bags in as many attempts in 46 games last season. After playing more second base in his debut, he spent most of 2024 at shortstop. He has solid arm strength, though his range is just average at short and he needs to improve his defensive consistency.

They got Carlos Ruiz for $8,000 back in 1999, and he helped them win a World Series less than a decade later. In January 2023, they spent $90,000 to sign Tait out of Panama, and the early returns have been very encouraging. The young catcher raked in the Dominican Summer League after signing, then played his way from the Florida Complex League to full-season ball before he turned 18 during his first trip to the United States in 2024. He went to the All-Star Futures Game in 2025 and had recently been bumped from Single-A Clearwater to High-A Jersey Shore when he was sent along with Mick Abel to the Twins in the Jhoan Duran Trade Deadline deal. A left-handed-hitting backstop, Tait has already displayed some impressive hitting traits. He finds the barrel consistently and makes a lot of hard contact. He’s capable of driving the ball to all fields and can hit the ball out everywhere, showing good power for such a young age. Like many young hitters with pop, he can get a little pull happy at times but should be able to learn to trust his natural strength and bat speed as he progresses. While Tait’s overall defensive game is a work in progress, there's reason to believe he’s headed in the right direction after showing a lot of improvement behind the dish last year. He sets up well and his receiving has gotten better to the point where they think he could be an average defender in the future, pairing nicely with his plus arm. If that keeps trending in that direction, Tait should have no problem being a big league regular catcher in the future.

Baseball has been catching players lie about their ages more and more, and lying about your age has really always been a thing in spots. I remember back in 2021 the Danny Almonte Little League World Series controversy where he ended up being two years older than claimed. I always assumed it was kinda an open secret that teams knew the players real ages internally, and it seems MLB is now trying to crack down on it. It’s always something I had in the back of my mind, but it’s never something I took into account when ranking players. I can’t just make wild speculations on which players are older than they claim, and beyond that, try to guess how much older. It just seems like too many wild goose chases, witch hunts, etc … and it’s just not something I want to poison my love for the game and prospects with. I want to get excited about these players, not think about them with a cloud of suspicion. I’m not using the Tait blurb to say all this for any reason other than being a professional baseball player at 16 years old is cool as hell, ha, and not only that, he’s a damn good one. He ripped up the DSL in 2023, and then he came stateside in 2024 and just kept on raking. He smacked 6 homers with a 14.6% K% and 132 wRC+ in 51 games in rookie ball, and then he got the call to Single-A and crushed 5 homers with a 28.9% K% and 117 wRC+ in 28 games. He did this as a 17 year old. He’s a thick 6’0” with a whip quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to launch the ball. There are questions if he can stick behind the plate and he chases a lot, so plenty of refinement is still needed, but who didn’t need refinement at 17 years old. He’s a really good candidate to be one of the best offensive catcher prospects in the game in the next 1-2 years. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 64/24/77/.260/.318/.450/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5657894736842105,0.868421052631579,0.32894736842105265,0.881578947368421,0.7236842105263157,64.18,87.5,,,74.31906614785993,2,0.5,67.8394536316472,65.46080877107653,1.0,2–4 yr,-3.591666700000001,93.10000040000001,55.0,68.90224269132295,22.0,Power,57.32600929109534,sa3022162,playerId

He was a solid performer in the Dominican Summer League in his first season with a 97 wRC+ in his first 37 games and took off more stateside last year. The third baseman hit .303/.351/.472 with six homers in 53 games in the Arizona Complex League in his age-18 campaign and even got in a pair of games with Single-A Visalia to round out 2024. Soler looks relaxed from the right side of the box, lifts his lead leg a little and then relies on his hands to fire. It works because he’s able to manipulate the barrel well and put bat on ball consistently. His 17.2 percent strikeout rate in the ACL was solid for a player with his age and experience, though he did start to expand the zone much more than he had in the DSL. He’s already well built in his 5-foot-11 frame, and the raw power is above average. But he gets on top of the ball too often (50.3 percent ground-ball rate in the ACL), and he’ll continue to need to add lift to get to that pop. Soler has been third base-only at this early stage in his career, and D-backs officials feel like he’s a good fit for the position with good reads and reactions off the bat and plenty of arm strength for throws across the diamond, despite below-average speed overall. He’ll head to full-season ball for a longer look in 2025 and to potentially solidify his standing in Arizona’s infield corps.

He has a quick and powerful righty swing from a strong 5’1l” frame that definitely looks the part. He also makes a ton of contact with a 17.2% K%. He hits the ball on the ground too much (50.3% GB%), so the 6 homers in 55 games isn’t impressive, but his hard hit ability still led to a .303/..351/.472 triple-slash.

The Cardinals selected him 21st overall that July and signed him for slot at $3,618,200. St. Louis played it fairly passively with Davis out of the gate in 2024 with an assignment to Single-A Palm Beach, and he didn’t crack out of the level for 74 games, hitting .232/.337/.401 with eight homers in that span. He was much better after a late July promotion to High-A Peoria (.301/.388/.451 in 30 games) and even finished things out with a quick trip to Double-A Springfield. The left-handed slugger worked through numerous swing and approach changes in his first full season but appears to be at his best with a swing that often draws comparisons to Carlos Gonzalez with his hands starting high near his head, his stance open and his front leg kicking to generate forward momentum. His raw power numbers are still clearly above average and he can pull the ball well, especially heaters. But soft stuff tailing away from him can be an issue when it comes to whiffs or quality contact. Even during the good times at High-A, he ran a 55.6 percent ground-ball rate, and he's continued to miss on a ton of offspeed pitches in 2025. Davis gets most of his reps in center field, but with average speed and plus arm strength, he figures to land in a corner full time as he closes in on St. Louis. That puts added pressure on the raw power to come through in games, and with his whiff rates with Springfield, that's becoming a tall order.

He slashed .252/.349/.417 with 12 homers, 9 steals, and a 23.8/11.8 K%/BB% in 112 games at mostly Single-A and High-A. He got a cup of coffee in the upper minors to close out the season and put up a 103 wRC+ in 8 games. He still has that smooth and athletic lefty swing, but the raw power has only been above average at best, and it comes with a low launch (47.5% GB%). He doesn’t have the hit tool, speed or defensive value to really make up for the power not being standout. It’s just not a very unique profile as a good but not great corner outfield bat, and I’m kinda being generous even saying “good” there. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 51/14/53/.251/.325/.423/5",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.48623853211009177,0.3577981651376147,0.7431192660550459,0.3761467889908257,0.08256880733944949,44.77,0.0,,,52.723735408560316,2,0.5,26.142185473411157,38.250264915693904,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.3638888999999992,54.36666679999999,55.0,44.25357949470817,22.0,OBP,38.48744413261868,sa3022426,playerId

The Padres selected him in the fourth round of that year’s Draft, gave him a slot-value bonus of $511,600 and pushed him to Double-A for San Antonio’s postseason push. He returned to High-A for his first full season, only to be dealt from San Diego to Tampa Bay at the Trade Deadline as part of a three-player deal for reliever Jason Adam. Bush is built like a young defensive end; a physical specimen with natural raw power and elite speed -- a tick below Chandler Simpson, who practically breaks the scale with his wheels. He preferred to keep his strikeouts down and emphasize his bat-to-ball skills by choking up on the bat and spreading out in the box, crouched over and closed off. That approach worked, as he put balls in play and let his speed work. But the Rays wanted to tap into his size and explosiveness, so they worked last fall to get him more upright in the box, with more of a hand load and a leg kick to unleash his bat speed and turn his strength into game power. Regardless, Bush offers value with his speed on the bases -- he stole 57 bases in 114 games last year -- and his excellent defense in center field. He has a ton of range, and his instincts, jumps and reads have continued to improve. The Rays view him as their best defensive outfielder, and they’re known for having a high bar for center-field defense, having leaned in recent years on speedsters like Kevin Kiermaier and Jose Siri. If his significant swing change takes hold and works as planned, Bush could support his speed-and-defense profile with much more upside offensively than he’s shown so far.

He’s the type where he can do what he does regardless of the competition, which is run like wild (57 steals) and get the bat on the ball (18.8/9.3 K%/BB%). He’s 6’2”, 200 pounds, so he has the size to add more power, but it’s really not a big part of his game with 6 homers.

Questions about his athleticism arose during his junior season, so he dropped to the 15th overall pick, where the White Sox signed him for $3.9 million. He has slashed just .233/.313/.326 while reaching Double-A in his first two pro seasons, though he did star in the Southern League playoffs last September as Birmingham won the championship. After controlling the strike zone and making consistent contact in college, Gonzalez has continued to do the same in pro ball. But the 25-homer upside he showed as an amateur hasn't translated, and it now looks like he'll have to add some strength and use a more selectively aggressive approach to produce 12-15 per year. Even after making adjustments to quicken his load and give him a better left-handed swing path, he still struggled to pull pitches or drive them with much authority in 2024. Gonzalez is a below-average runner with solid instincts on the bases but questions about his ability to remain at shortstop. He's a sure-handed defender with solid arm strength and a good internal clock, and the White Sox think he can cover enough ground at short. Others think he's better suited for second base (where he saw some action last season) or third base, which would put more demands on his bat.

Chicago actually isn’t that weak in the infield anymore, but that is only theoretical as nobody is established, so Gonzalez should certainly get some opportunities to battle for playing time in the near future. When you take a guy 15th overall, you generally want to give him a look, no matter how mediocre the pro career has been, and it’s been damn mediocre. He just put up a .225/.284/.321 triple slash with 5 homers, 10 steals, and a 14.0/6.9 K%/BB% in 94 games at Double-A. He gets the bat on the ball and he has a solid infield glove and that is about it. He’s only relevant in probably like 30 teamers, but the opportunity I forsee him eventually getting is why he barely cracks the list. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 63/12/48/.252/.321/.392/10",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2222222222222222,0.25,0.1388888888888889,0.20833333333333334,0.8472222222222222,28.94,46.42857142857143,,,0.3891050583657574,2,0.5,16.63638363905874,24.63373427367056,1.0,0–1 yr,-2.8500000000000014,84.20000000000002,55.0,35.93712028210117,22.0,Contact,40.711704126945534,sa3022498,playerId

Milwaukee selected the hulking infielder 18th overall in 2023, signed him for $3.15 million and got aggressive with him in his first full season with an opening assignment to Double-A Biloxi. He was hit in the face by a fastball on April 11 in just his fifth game of 2024, missed roughly a month and never quite recovered in terms of results, finishing with a .199/.312/.363 line and 17 homers in 108 games with the Shuckers. A move to the Arizona Fall League, where he batted .155 with 32 strikeouts in 100 plate appearances, didn’t do much to end the year on a high note. It's tough to balance the impact of the early-season HBP, as well as the move to the pitcher-friendly Southern League. Batting hunched over from the right side with a toe tap, the Demon Deacons legend is built to rip hard-hit balls in the air to the pullside, and he still has ample strength. His 17 homers were fourth-most in the SL, but he’s also proved to be extremely vulnerable to soft stuff low and away, and pitchers took advantage. To his credit, he'd done an impressive job of cutting down on his chase rate in a return to Biloxi in 2025 and looked to be pushing for a move to Triple-A before suffering a dislocated patella in his left knee. A well-below-average runner, Wilken has been third-base-only in pro ball, and while he has ample arm strength for the hot corner, he still might be a better fit at first base long-term, given his range and 6-foot-4 frame. His early 2025 trajectory provided hope that he could still be valuable at either corner-infield spot when healthy.

There definitely seems to be a path to playing time, and there is little doubt that he will hit dingers and get on base when he gets that chance with 17 homers and a 13.4% BB% in 108 games at Double-A. The hit tool was worse than we hoped for with a .199 BA and 28.2% K%, but some of that was definitely bad BABIP luck. He was also hit in the face with a pitch on April 11th, sustaining multiple facial fractures, so I think we can cut him some extra slack for that, although he performed better the first 3 months after returning than he did in August and September, so maybe that is just an excuse. Either way, I’m betting on the monster power, pedigree (18th pick in the 2023 MLB Draft) and opportunity. – 2025 Projection: 27/11/36/.219/.296/.427/1 Prime Projection: 75/28/86/.238/.320/.476/2",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9724770642201835,0.981651376146789,0.9174311926605505,0.926605504587156,0.2018348623853211,85.62,35.71428571428571,50.0,,83.26848249027238,3,0.75,55.03482326782853,74.91518814373998,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.8972222999999993,60.76666759999999,70.0,78.680556583122,17.0,Power+OBP,59.0095839824049,sa3022499,playerId

He was a 15th round pick in 2023, but he stepped right into pro ball and raked with 6 homers and a .910 OPS in 36 games at mostly Single-A. In 2024, he just kept on producing, but this time he did it in the upper minors, slashing .348/.408/.493 with 2 homers, 1 steal, and a 23.7/9.2 K%/BB% in 18 games at Double-A. He destroyed High-A too with 16 homers and a 142 wRC+ in 109 games. He’s 6’3”, 225 pounds with a powerful righty swing, and he can lift and pull it, so his power is legit. The bat has a high bar to clear, making the most reasonable projection as a part time power bat, but if he does get playing time, he can hit homers. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 58/16/64/.245/.318/.438/3",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.26605504587155965,0.5412844036697247,0.10091743119266056,0.3577981651376147,0.39449541284403666,31.89,,,,27.82101167315175,1,0.25,21.561284046692606,28.274949416342412,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.0944445000000016,51.13333400000002,40.0,33.69198492490273,27.0,Contact,29.33806001620623,sa3022530,playerId

Lasko provided hope as the next in line for the program, hitting .314 with a .988 OPS over his three-year college career. That strong showing, along with showcase opportunities at the Team USA trials and in the Cape Cod League, led to the A’s selecting him in the second round of the 2023 Draft. His first full professional season last year brought mixed results. Overall, he combined to hit .232 with six home runs, 26 doubles, 47 RBIs and 33 stolen bases in 124 games between Single-A Stockton and High-A Lansing. Despite the up-and-down numbers, Lasko showed good plate discipline, though there are some swing-and-miss and pitch recognition issues the A’s would like to see him correct, especially against pitches up in the zone. There was intrigue over his power potential coming out of college, but that has yet to truly translate to the pro ranks. Lasko’s defense is clearly ahead of his offense right now as the standout trait of his game. He has a plus arm that allows him to cut down baserunners, and his good speed also allows him to cover plenty of ground in center field, giving him a real chance to stick at the position long-term. The A’s love the toughness and blue-collar nature of his playing style. How much he can improve his hit tool will likely determine what type of role might eventually await him at the highest level.

The D-backs selected him 12th overall in 2023, but injuries have dogged him since -- first a fractured left foot in his Draft year and later a left hamstring strain that held him out for two months in his first full season. He hit just .227/.319/.347 with five homers in 65 games for High-A Hillsboro in ’24 but ended with a particularly hot streak in the Arizona Fall League (.290/.380/.484, 11 extra-base hits in 22 games). Which Troy is the real pro prospect is something many are trying to figure out. The right-handed hitter, who starts his load with a leg kick, battled inconsistency in the Northwest League and lost rhythm at the plate, often struggling against breaking pitches. After putting in a lot of work in the cage, he learned to let the ball travel in the zone more and got back to some of what he did best at Stanford -- shooting the ball toward the middle of the field with authority. He can pack a punch from his 5-foot-9 frame with quick hands and good bat speed. Troy remains at least an above-average runner even after all the lower-body injuries. He saw more time at second base than shortstop in the Fall League, and the D-backs expect him to keep getting a lion’s share of looks at the keystone, where he’s less stretched on balls in the hole. A fully healthy Troy could be a very productive one or at least one who provides clearer answers on his future fit in Arizona’s middle-infield plans.

He then went to the AFL and kept on hitting with a .864 OPS in 22 games. A hamstring injury knocked out 2 months of his season early in the year, and it seemed like he just couldn’t find a rhythm when he returned, so there is something to point to for the slow start. The skills and general explosiveness of his game that got him drafted 12th overall are all still there. His hype definitely dropped this year, but I would be careful about selling too low here. He’s still a Top 100 prospect for me. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/18/71/.251/.320/.427/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.625,0.5277777777777778,0.8194444444444444,0.6527777777777778,0.8194444444444444,67.53,81.81818181818181,71.42857142857143,,82.29571984435798,3,0.75,73.03711880932069,69.45749158326224,1.0,0–1 yr,-2.480555599999999,79.76666719999999,70.0,69.94374755497867,17.0,OBP,58.8780198397404,sa3022561,playerId

Signed for a below-slot $1.4 million in the second round, he lost the first two months of the 2024 season to a broken hamate that still sapped his power for a while after he returned. Fully healthy in the Arizona Fall League, he bashed six homers in nine games and produced the hardest-hit ball (119.5 mph) of the season before leaving to get married. At 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, Alderman possesses massive strength and leverage and has drawn physical comparisons to Hunter Renfroe. Some evaluators grade his raw power at the top of the 20-80 scouting scale, and he's capable of blasting the ball out of the park from foul pole to foul pole. He has a surprisingly compact right-handed swing considering the size and damage he does, though he's prone to chasing all types of pitches out of the zone, which results in a lot of strikeouts and groundball contact. More athletic than most players his size, Alderman has below-average speed but isn't a baseclogger and can steal an occasional base. He gets the job done on the outfield corners and has a strong arm that pumped fastball up to 94 mph when he pitched sporadically for the Rebels.

He battled through a wrist injury as a junior, showing enough for the Pirates to take him in the second round of the 2023 Draft and sign him for an under-slot $1.65 million. He had an uneven first full season of pro ball with High-A Greensboro, starting very slowly but then righting the ship, hitting .289 with a .372 on-base percentage and 27 steals from July 1 until the end of the season. A left-handed hitter with a reputation as a contact hitter, Jebb may have let the hitting-friendly environs in Greensboro get in his head. He tried to muscle up too much, leading to a .564 OPS and a very uncharacteristic 26.3 percent strikeout rate over the season’s first two months. He started to find himself in June and then was scorching hot in July and August, getting back to his mature approach, trusting his ability to shoot the gaps with line drives and using his at least plus speed to wreak havoc on the basepaths. His K rate dropped to 13.2 percent from July on, and his walk rate shot back up as well. A shortstop in college, Jebb is still getting time at the premium position, but he played more second base last year and got his feet wet in center field as well. He doesn’t pass the eye test to some on the infield, but the Pirates want to try to keep him on the dirt, though he’ll likely get more reps in center to see what that looks like.

He quickly adjusted to pro ball that summer at Single-A Lakeland, earning a bump up to High-A West Michigan, where a decent season showed the challenges to his approach. His late-season adjustments led to a promotion to Double-A Erie in time for their Eastern League championship run. Anderson is a bat-first infielder with a quick, slashing swing that makes consistent contact all over the field. The quality of that contact was his challenge at West Michigan, with a 50-percent ground-ball rate compared to just 22 percent line drives. Anderson’s trademark power from Nebraska didn’t immediately translate into pro ball, but it’s come along nicely in 2025 as he’s cut down on those grounders and pulled the ball more. Defensively, Anderson is a reliable fielder whose size limits his range and whose arm limits him. For Anderson, the bat will determine how far he goes in the system. His subtle improvements and adjustments to High-A pitching show the potential for him to be a late bloomer, and that’s come to bear in his age-23 season. The Tigers have started to fold in looks for Anderson at third base as he asserts his place in the organization’s infield depth chart.

That’s what the Rockies are learning about Carrigg after taking him in Competitive Balance Round B of the 2023 Draft. He had spent three years at San Diego State doing just about everything but selling hot dogs, showing flashes of all five tools while playing all over the diamond. He followed up a solid pro debut after signing by leading the High-A Northwest League in home runs (16) and finishing second in stolen bases (51) while whittling down his defensive homes. A super high-energy player who gets some “hair on fire” evaluations, Carrigg is a switch-hitter who makes a ton of contact from both sides of the plate. There was some concern about his aggressive nature and hit tool and how it would translate to this level, but the transition has gone well so far as Carrigg doesn’t strike out much and even drew a decent amount of walks. There’s more pop than many expected, with most of it coming from the left side of the plate to his pull side. He also can turn singles into extra-base hits and doubles into triples -- he led the league in three-baggers, too -- with his plus speed clearly an asset and giving him at least 20-30 potential. With one of the best arms in baseball, there were some who wanted to see if catching would work at this level, but that’s been shelved. He’ll keep getting some reps on the dirt at shortstop to maintain some versatility, but it should surprise no one if he shows up to Coors Field as an every day center fielder.

The Rockies High-A park is also notoriously hitter friendly, with many of their hitters immediately falling off in their Double-A ballpark. At best, you can use his lack of time at Double-A as a buying opportunity, because there is a lot to like, but at worst, it could be a trap. The rosy outlook on Carrigg is that he’s 6’2”, 200 pounds with about average power (16 homers in 111 games at High-A), an average hit tool (19.0/9.8 K%/BB%), double plus baserunning (53 steals), and defensive versality which should add value. The less rosy outlook is that the hit tool drops to below average at higher levels and he won’t have the power to make up for it, relegating him to a utility role. If we saw it at Double-A, I would be more apt to buy into the first narrative, but until I do, I’m staying a little cautious. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 74/16/67/.262/.323/.417/28",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4954128440366973,0.7752293577981652,0.3302752293577982,0.6513761467889908,0.1651376146788991,49.8,92.5925925925926,57.14285714285714,95.65217391304348,58.365758754863805,4,1.0,72.20970408502129,57.643396429757445,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.7888888999999999,59.4666668,85.0,53.60301894892723,12.0,Contact,51.21469188701725,sa3022596,playerId

A lack of power depressed Bateman's Draft stock, even after he hit .500 during a two-week stint in the Cape Cod League, and he fell to Chicago in the eighth round. He ranked second in on-base percentage (.401) and fourth in batting (.283) in the High-A Midwest League before scuffling in Double-A during his first full pro season, becoming the subject of repeated trade inquiries because of his outstanding defensive metrics. Bateman is a study in extremes from the left side of the plate. He almost never chases pitches or swings and misses, especially in the zone, but he also rarely hits balls hard or in the air. Just 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, he builds his offensive game around shooting grounders into gaps in the defense and getting on base at the expense of any power. He slugged just .324 last year, with one homer and 16 extra-base hits in 107 games. An intelligent player who understands his strengths and weaknesses, Bateman translates his plus-plus speed into beating out hits, stealing bases and covering wide swaths of ground in center field. A two-way player before elbow surgery following his freshman season with the Gophers, he has regained solid arm strength and recorded 14 assists in his first 136 pro starts in center. His biggest backers think he's a lesser version of Orioles 2023 first-rounder Enrique Bradfield Jr., while more skeptical evaluators think his ceiling is Myles Straw.

Miller looked like one of the best high school hitters in the 2023 Draft class after a tremendous summer showcase performance, but because he broke his left hamate, teams didn’t see him enough that spring, enabling him to land with the Phillies at No. 27 overall. He immediately returned their faith by hitting his way from Single-A to Double-A by the end of his first full season, with a stop at the Futures Game along the way. Miller entered pro ball with a reputation for having tremendous raw pop, even if some thought he might be a power-over-hit type. He’s proven to have a solid approach and limit strikeouts while drawing walks, as well as having acumen at making adjustments as he’s seen new levels of pitching, doing things like cutting down the hitch and hand pump in his swing mechanics that some evaluators worried about. He’s improved his swing decisions, with confidence he could be an above-average hitter who knows he can get to his power naturally. While Miller played shortstop in high school, nearly everyone thought he’d have to move to third as he continued to physically mature. But he’s only played short thus far as a pro, and he’s driven to prove he can stay at the premium position. There were plans for him to be exposed to third and second base in 2025 to provide options to get his bat in the big league lineup when it was deemed ready, but it turned out he only played shortstop or got at-bats as a designated hitter.

His big, quick and powerful righty swing was what everyone fell in love with originally, and he proved he can combine that with a good feel to hit, a good approach, and good athleticism. He can also play a decent SS, so his glove is likely to stick somewhere on the infield and potentially end up an asset as well. He’s not exactly standout in any one area at the moment, but there is power upside in the bat which gives him the ceiling of a do everything, middle of the order masher. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 82/25/86/.269/.342/.468/15",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9305555555555556,0.5972222222222222,0.8611111111111112,0.5694444444444444,0.4305555555555556,73.0,93.75,83.33333333333334,100.0,94.16342412451361,4,1.0,92.2280317769131,79.7298111219196,1.0,0–1 yr,-4.875,100.0,85.0,79.06894333657588,12.0,OBP,70.78102450145916,sa3022609,playerId

The Mariners liked what they saw enough to take him in the fourth round and sign the Mississippi State commit for a $1.2 million bonus, more than double the slot value. He was off to a strong full-season debut at only 19 years old when the Mariners dealt him to the Rays, who viewed him as the lead piece in their return for Randy Arozarena. Smith doesn’t necessarily have a standout tool at this point, but there are some in Tampa Bay’s organization who believe he could already be the best prospect in the system. He does everything well, albeit nothing to an off-the-charts degree. He’s a natural athlete, listed at 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds. He shows good balance and a controlled stride at the plate but has struggled against non-fastballs in 2025. He added a good amount of strength in his first offseason in the Tampa Bay system, impressing evaluators across the system, and he could be ready to turn some of his doubles (33 over 97 games in 2024) into homers in his age-20 season and beyond. There are some questions about his defense in center field, as Seattle had him spend a roughly equal amount of time in the corners to prioritize other players, but he has a plus arm and plenty of speed to handle the position. The Rays have let him spend most of his time in center in his first full season with the organization. They have a strong track record when it comes to acquiring high-upside prospects, and although there have been bumps in 2025, Smith's high ceiling remains.

Isaac Paredes proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the righty lift and pull profile can thrive in Tampa, and that is Smith’s game with a 35.7% GB% and 54.4% Pull% (11 homers in 97 games at Single-A). He combines that with projectable power at 6’2”, 190 pounds, plus speed with 41 steals in 47 attempts, and a strong plate approach with a 23.2/14.4 K%/BB%. The hit tool is still on the risky side, but if he gains meaningful raw power as he enters his 20’s, he has true explosion potential.

Signing for an over-slot $2.5 million, Stafura struggled in his first brief taste of pro ball in the Arizona Complex League but clearly learned some lessons he brought with him into 2024, when he posted a 1.031 OPS in 15 games back in the ACL to earn a promotion to Single-A Daytona, where he continued to show impressive on-base skills and basestealing acumen. It was more of the same back in Daytona for the 2025 season when he was sent to the Pirates close to the Trade Deadline for Ke’Bryan Hayes. Staying more athletic in the box will continue to be key for Stafura, along with using the big parts of the field, rather than trying to muscle up too much. A bat wrap he used back in high school can show up at times, making it a little tougher for him to catch up to elite fastballs, but he’s shown that he can make adjustments and has a pretty good idea of the strike zone, so there’s confidence that more reps will help him address those things. He uses his speed very well, turning his .384 on-base percentage with Daytona over two years into 55 steals in 166 games. Stafura’s athleticism is an athlete on the dirt as well. He’s played shortstop almost exclusively thus far in his pro career and there are no plans to change that, and he has the range, hands, actions and arm to stick there long term. He’s gotten high marks for his passion for the game and his work ethic, with considerable ceiling to reach as he continues to learn about what it takes to manage a season-long workload.

After putting up a 7 wRC+ with a 43.4% K% in 12 rookie ball games in 2023, he then hit pretty well in full season ball in 2024, slashing .270/.387/.412 with 8 homers, 31 steals, and a 24.7/15.2 K%/BB% in 92 games at Single-A. I give respect where it’s due, and his value definitely rose from last year, but he’s still not really all that enticing of a prospect, so I don’t think the poor pro debut rankings drop led you in the wrong direction. The 85.9 MPH EV was low and the 24.7% K% was high. That’s not a great combo, and he’s really not all that electric of an athlete at 6’0” with good but not great athleticism. It’s just not that unique or enticing of a profile. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 77/16/63/.251/.325/.412/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8157894736842105,0.6842105263157895,0.8552631578947368,0.6447368421052632,0.4078947368421053,72.03,75.86206896551724,,,15.56420233463035,2,0.5,34.585066416208235,58.924273245672886,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.8083333999999986,71.70000079999998,55.0,68.04878209370186,22.0,OBP,52.661952102165834,sa3022612,playerId

The Twins were creative with their bonus pool and nabbed Winokur in the third round, giving him $1.5 million -- second-round money -- to sign. They were thrilled how much the tools showed up during his first full season in the largely pitching-friendly Florida State League, and while he has plenty to work on, he finished third in the league in OPS and in the top 10 in home runs (14) and wRC+ (116). Winokur is capable of flashing close to plus tools almost across the board on any given day. While there's definitely work to be done on his overall approach after a 115/34 K/BB ratio last year, he actually cut down on his K rate compared to his brief debut in the Florida Complex League. Because of the 6-foot-6 right-handed hitter's long levers, there's always going to be some swing-and-miss, and while he'll be focusing on his feel for contact and plate discipline moving forward, the Twins can live with some strikeouts if he reaches his considerable power potential. Perhaps the best overall athlete in the system, Winokur can really run, especially underway, and should continue to be a basestealing threat. His arm works very well from a number of positions, and while someone his size typically doesn't profile at shortstop, he was pretty solid at the premium position. He'll keep getting reps at third and also could end up being a good defender in center field or an elite one in right.

His big time power is obvious, and it resulted in 14 homers with a 89.6 MPH EV in 94 games at Single-A. The area of his game that gets considerably underrated, is how good of an athlete he is. He put up plus run times in high school, and then he went out and stole 23 bags in 29 attempts this year. He played both SS and CF this year. This is not some lumbering corner bat. This is a unicorn with real defensive value. The problem, of course, is the hit tool. He put up a 28.0/8.3 K%/BB% and he swings and misses a lot. There is no denying there is very real risk here, but that is why he isn’t like a Top 50 prospect. As is, I believe he is a top 100 fantasy prospect, and he won’t be valued anywhere close to that in off-season prospect drafts. He’s a major target. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/26/83/.246/.317/.471/15",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4605263157894737,0.8289473684210527,0.2631578947368421,0.7236842105263158,0.39473684210526316,52.38,57.14285714285714,,,81.71206225680933,2,0.5,60.753659440429864,55.310780804150454,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.8944444999999988,72.73333399999999,55.0,56.31223434124514,22.0,Contact,47.58717225356031,sa3022613,playerId

I like Brock Wilken to take the job based on pedigree and upside, but just because I like that, doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. Boeve proved his hit tool will transfer to the upper minors, slashing .306/.374/.447 with 6 homers, 1 steal, and a 17.0/9.3 K%/BB% in 66 games. He has some raw power, but the launch is low and it’s a line drive approach, so there isn’t big homer upside, and he doesn’t run much. He’s not a small guy at a thick 6’1”, so it’s possible for him to tap into more game power down the line. This isn’t a profile I love buying into, but with the current opening at 3B, I can’t ignore the possibility that he could hit his way into the role pretty quickly. – 2025 Projection: 23/5/27/.249/.300/.385/1 Prime Projection: 68/15/65/.269/.326/.418/4",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.46788990825688076,0.30275229357798167,0.5137614678899083,0.3211009174311927,0.42201834862385323,41.66,,0.0,,33.85214007782101,2,0.5,16.785019455252915,32.953756809338515,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.7805555999999996,59.366667199999995,55.0,41.70412712280156,22.0,Contact,38.340190645260705,sa3022658,playerId

The fastest player in the 2023 Draft, the Texas high schooler went 36th overall to the Dodgers and signed for a below-slot $1,847,500. He continues to dazzle with his speed and stole 36 bases in 84 Single-A games last year, but there are questions about his bat and impact after he struck out at a 21 percent clip and slugged just .328. Some scouts have joked that George possesses 90 speed on the 20-80 scale, and he got from the left side of the plate to first base in 3.4 seconds on a bunt in a PDP League game in 2022. His quickness enables him to run wild on the bases and cover wide swaths of ground in center field, though he needs to refine his reads and jumps so he could become dominant in both regards. He's a potential big league basestealing champ and Gold Glover, though he comes with a below-average arm. George understands his strengths and weaknesses at the plate, recognizing that he lacks the physicality to be a slugger and should focus on getting on base. Los Angeles has helped him incorporate his legs more in his left-handed stroke and to learn how to pull and lift balls more frequently so pitchers will have to respect him, changes that have produced higher exit velocities but also more swing and miss. He still doesn't drive balls particularly hard and produces a lot of grounders to the left side of the infield, but he can turn those into infield hits.

The Nationals were happy to take him when he was available in the second round in 2023 and signed him for above slot at $2.6 million. Continuing with that enthusiasm, Washington opened Morales at Double-A Harrisburg in his first full season, only for the corner infielder to suffer a serious left thumb injury on a plate at the plate in his 37th game on May 18. He didn’t return to the Senators lineup until Aug. 9 but hit .304/.412/.426 over his final 32 games. So much of Morales’ 2024 was defined by the thumb, even after he returned because of the mental battle dealing with an injury to a key piece of the hitting apparatus. There’s hope that a full offseason of additional rest and recovery will help take away the concerns of a ghost injury and get Morales’ plus raw power to play in games again. At his best, he’s a large presence in the box with significant strength that could produce loud contact. At his shakiest, he struggles against sliders and changeups and gets on top of the ball too much, leading to groundball contact. With his good arm strength, Morales could sprinkle in some third base still, but with Brady House ahead of him and Cayden Wallace acquired last year, his best chance for upper Minors at-bats is at the first base spot. He’s still learning the nuances of the position but will need the power to return to collegiate levels soon if he’s going to be valuable at the cold corner.

The Tigers selected him third overall in 2023 and inked him to a below-slot $7.7 million deal that helped them select and sign Clark’s Team USA teammate Kevin McGonigle. The Hoosier Stater was a solid performer in his first full season, picking up Florida State League All-Star and Top Prospect honors after slashing .286/.386/.421 with seven homers and 26 steals in 73 games with Single-A Lakeland. He finished out his age-19 campaign with a solid 34-game turn at High-A West Michigan. The left-handed hitter is hit-over-power at this still-early age of his development. He ran solid contact rates against most pitch types (save for the slider) in the FSL and generally didn’t chase much, leading to healthy walk and strikeout rates. His exit velocities were around average for the level, and his power didn’t quite pop in terms of slugging numbers due to a high ground-ball rate. Just entering his 20s, Clark has already added strength from his amateur days, and if he adds a little more loft as part of that trajectory, there’s the potential for at least average power. The 6-foot outfielder can really fly with plus-plus run times and regularly exceeds 30 ft/sec Sprint Speeds when in front of Statcast, as he was in the FSL. It should be no surprise that he has played center field exclusively in the pros with that speed, and his plus arm strength gives him another weapon, having been recorded with an outfield throw as high as 98.1 mph. (Detroit Major Leaguers topped out at 96.2 from the grass in 2024.) Clark’s power could be what determines whether he’s a very good player or a true superstar.

He’s an absolutely electric player when you watch him with a vicious lefty swing and plus speed. He’s already one of the more exciting top of the order prospects in the lower minors, and when gains more power naturally, and starts lifting the ball a bit more (48% GB%), he can explode into a truly elite prospect. His hype has actually been relatively subdued considering how much pre draft hype he got, but make no mistake, Clark can be special. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 96/20/69/.277/.351/.443/30",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9357798165137615,0.7522935779816514,0.9724770642201835,0.8256880733944955,0.7889908256880733,87.01,96.2962962962963,90.0,,96.49805447470817,3,0.75,87.43795724082975,87.15978503429042,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.4083334,90.9000008,70.0,87.63843563028713,17.0,OBP,69.06729619362922,sa3022683,playerId

His top priority was to add muscle to his skinny 6-foot-1 frame and he has added about 15 pounds since turning pro. He showed steady improvement as a 19-year-old in Single-A last year and made the jump to High-A in 2025 before Houston sent him to the Marlins in a trade for Jesus Sanchez in July. A left-handed hitter, Jaworsky has good bat-to-ball skills but needs to improve his selectivity while continuing to gain strength. While he shows the ability to make adjustments and uses the entire field well, he currently makes a lot of soft groundball contact. Added physical development could result in 12-15 homers per year, though he'll always be a hit-over-power guy. Jaworsky's most obvious tool is his plus speed, which he used to steal 28 bases in 78 games last season. He has nice actions and range to both sides at shortstop, though there are questions as to whether his average arm will be enough to remain at the position. His quick release and good internal clock will help him, but some scouts think second base and center field are more realistic destinations.

HS in 2021 and could have been a top-three-rounds pick if not for his commitment to Oklahoma State. He turned down the Brewers in the 11th round and spent two years with the Cowboys that included a legendary NCAA Regionals playoff performance (15-for-27, four homers, five doubles, 17 RBIs in five games) as a freshman. A 2023 fourth-rounder, he slashed just .217/.356/.369 in his first year-plus in pro ball. Despite being slowed early by a hand injury, he was having an impressive bounce-back season and reached Double-A, only to be sent to the Rockies in the Trade Deadline deal for Jake Bird. Riggio has the build, bravado and max-effort swing of a lefty-hitting version of Dustin Pedroia, but he doesn't have the same feel for the barrel. He lives for launching balls in the air to right field and his solid raw power will play well in any big league ballpark, if he can keep making the improved contact he’s shown this year. He has a reasonably disciplined approach and draws walks, but his all-out stroke comes up empty too often against non-fastballs and when he does stray out of the strike zone. His aggressiveness is evident on the bases as well, as Riggio swiped 27 bags in his first full pro season despite below-average speed, though he wasn’t looking to run as much in 2025. His lack of quickness and fringy arm strength should limit his effectiveness at second base, but he has looked better than expected in the Minors and could become an average defender. The Yankees tried him briefly at shortstop last summer, but he doesn't possess the tools for the position and the game speeds up on him too much there.

His strikeout rate did go up, but he typically has had good pitch recognition and a solid approach, making good swing decisions and there’s confidence he’ll be able to make adjustments as he progresses. He’s not a burner, but he runs well and used his instincts to steal 42 bags in 2024. While he saw some time on the dirt at the start of his college career, and played a few games at second last year, Campbell has developed into a defensive outfielder. He used his plus arm to pick up 11 outfield assists a year ago and his speed allows him to cover a lot of ground. Right field might be his best spot, but his ability to play all three outfield positions points to a future career as a fourth-outfielder type.

They traded him just 10 months later, sending him to the Marlins as the headliner in a four-prospect package for Luis Arraez. He played in just five games with his new organization before injuring his left hip and requiring season-ending surgery, though he's fully healthy again for 2025. Head possesses at least plus-plus speed and gets top-of-the-scale grades from some evaluators. He uses his quickness to beat out infield hits and should be a terror on the bases once he learns the nuances of basestealing. He chases balls down from gap to gap and enhances his average-to-solid arm strength by getting to balls quickly. After making consistent contact to all fields in his pro debut, Head was much more aggressive and pull-happy before he got hurt last year. A left-handed hitter, he's at his best when he tries to hit balls from gap to gap and focuses on getting base. He's not very physical and won't be a slugger, but he has enough bat speed and strength to hit 12-15 homers per year and be more than just a slap hitter.

He signed for below slot at $4,897,500 with the savings going toward other members of the Draft class. In his first full season, Mitchell was named Kansas City's 2024 George Brett Hitter of the Year after slashing .238/.376/.439 with 18 homers in 106 games for Single-A Columbia. He finished out his age-19 season with five games for High-A Quad Cities, and his final 135 wRC+ between both spots was tops among Royals full-season Minor Leaguers and best among qualified full-season teenaged catchers. The start to his 2025 season was delayed when he broke his right hamate bone early in Spring Training. Batting from the left side, Mitchell has a swing designed for lift and pull, and the plurality of his contact came via flyballs in 2024. His load is rather simple with a slight leg lift, and the Royals worked with the backstop on keeping his stance from getting too wide in the box. He could challenge for 30-plus homers at his eventual peak. Mitchell isn't a quick runner but knows when to pick his spots on the basepaths -- ranking third in the Minors among catchers with 26 total steals. The Texas native has plus-plus arm strength -- he touched 97 mph as an amateur pitcher -- but he'll need to work on improving his accuracy after catching only 14.4 percent of attempted basestealers in 2024. As is typical of modern catchers, he isn't afraid of putting one knee down and getting low in his defensive stance to steal strikes, and he has the athleticism to receive and block well as he develops. K.C. knows something about having a homegrown franchise catcher, and Mitchell is on his way to that status as he enters his 20s.

He has a quick and powerful lefty swing that is made to lift and pull, giving him considerable power upside at peak, and while he’s not a burner, the 25 steals show how good of an athlete he is. He should at least chip in there. Of course, the big question is the hit tool. If he can just get to below average, he can be your classic low BA slugging catcher, but there is no guarantee he can get to that. Add a star in OBP leagues because he walks a ton, but the hit tool is going to have to show improvement no matter what. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 66/25/74/.227/.314/.438/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.75,0.3157894736842105,0.9605263157894737,0.3026315789473684,0.052631578947368474,55.2,96.42857142857143,92.3076923076923,96.42857142857143,74.12451361867704,4,1.0,87.59193141488862,66.53717599521102,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.5249999999999986,68.29999999999998,85.0,60.5661527985633,12.0,OBP,56.11476875935348,sa3022756,playerId

One of the youngest and most physical prospects in the '23 prep class, Wolkow lasted longer than expected but landed early third-round money ($1 million) in the seventh round. He tore up Rookie ball for two weeks to start his 2024 season, then slashed .241/.342/.428 with 11 homers in 76 games as the youngest regular (age 18) in the Single-A Carolina League. Wolkow has a massive 6-foot-7, 239-pound frame with more strength and leverage than most players his age. Add in his bat speed and he has as much power upside as anyone in the Minors. He's still growing and showing some aptitude for launching balls in the air, and he could produce 40 homers annually if he makes enough contact. That's a question, however, because his size results in a naturally long left-handed stroke. He'll miss some fastballs in the strike zone and chase non-fastballs more than he should, resulting in a 40 percent strikeout rate in 2024, though he improved throughout the year and the White Sox believe he'll make adjustments as he gains experience. Built like a tight end, Wolkow takes time to get out of the batter's box but moves well for his size and is at least an average runner underway. He played well at third base during the 2022 Area Code Games and some scouts think he could handle the hot corner, but he's more comfortable in right field and has the solid arm for the position. Club officials love his makeup, repeatedly praising his intelligence, maturity and competitive will.

This is a no joke unicorn type talent, but like a lot of no joke unicorn type talents, the hit tool is a major question. And for Wolkow, it’s getting close to off the charts with a 38.8% K% at stateside rookie and a 40.6% K% at Single-A. He walks a lot too, and he’s very young, but that really isn’t a strikeout rate you just hand wave away. It’s why he really can’t be close to consideration for a Top 100 spot, but it won’t stop me from valuing him in the Top 200 range.

After he held his own as one of the youngest performers in the Draft League that summer, he was taken by the Phillies, who didn’t have a second-round selection, in the third round of that Draft, signing for an under-slot bonus of $602,500. After a brief debut in the Florida Complex League last year, Saltiban went to the Florida State League in 2024 and more than held his own, finishing in the top four in homers (17), slugging percentage (.428) and ISO (.191). Strong and compact, Saltiban has more juice in his 5-foot-9 frame than many anticipated. It’s a quick right-handed swing with plenty of bat speed, and he swings with intent to do damage, regularly registering high exit velocities. Most of his home run pop has come to his pull side so far, though he can drive the ball to all fields. He absolutely punishes fastballs and has shown a solid approach at the plate, drawing a good amount of walks, though he’ll need to improve against spin. A plus runner who went 22-for-24 in stolen-base attempts last year, Saltiban was an outfielder in high school, but the Phillies thought he had a chance to make it on the dirt and played second base exclusively in 2024. He’s probably a fringe-average defender right now, and though his athleticism points to him being average at the keystone in the future, he might get some reps in the outfield moving forward.

If the strikeout rate was a bit better, I could see being even higher on him, but I’m a fan. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/17/71/.253/.325/.417/23",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.13157894736842105,0.5789473684210527,0.05263157894736842,0.19736842105263158,0.10526315789473684,21.78,18.75,,69.23076923076923,19.260700389105057,3,0.75,26.903144642322655,23.57310062481293,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.0555556000000017,74.66666720000002,70.0,30.250930267443884,17.0,Contact,39.99625206034976,sa3022827,playerId

The Brewers took the California native in the 2023 third round, signed him for above slot at $1.75 million and played it slow with him out of the gate considering he was still only 17 on Draft Day. Bitonti opened his first full season in the Arizona Complex League and laid waste to the Rookie level with a .320/.451/.580 line and eight homers in 51 games. He was promoted to Single-A Carolina in late July and continued to slug there with eight more homers in 28 games. His 16 total dingers were second-most in the Minors among players 18 or younger. Standing in the box at 6-foot-4, Bitonti already exhibits absolutely electric bat speed, registering in the mid-70s at times, and he’s already built like a house with the strength to turn most contact into loud contact. (Forty-two of his 83 hits in 2024 went for extra bases.) But with that comes a ton of swing-and-miss concerns at this early stage. His long levers contribute partly to the problem, and the Brewers hold out hope that shortening the swing some could lead to more overall contact. Bitonti was drafted as a shortstop but has primarily slid over to third in pro ball. The majority of his starts with Carolina came at the opposite corner at first base, and many believe that’s where he’ll land full-time as a fairly athletic defender and big target for his fellow infielders. Bitonti’s power will certainly play there as is, and he has plenty of runway to make other tweaks to unlock his hit tool in time.

He has future elite power hitting prospect written all over him at 6’4”, 218 pounds with a powerful, athletic and sweet lefty swing that is made to hit bombs. He smoked 8 homers with a 157 wRC+ in 51 games at the age appropriate stateside rookie ball, and then he got called up to Single-A and went nuclear with 8 homers in just 28 games. With his raw power and an over 50% FB%, he can’t not hit homers. He also gets on base a ton with a 16.5% BB%, which offsets some of the swing and miss issues (27.9% K%). And he’s a good athlete with 12 steals in 15 attempts over 79 games, so he should contribute at least a handful in that category. Definitely go after him everywhere. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/33/97/.242/.331/.497/8",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8108108108108109,0.8918918918918919,0.6351351351351351,0.8513513513513513,0.10810810810810811,70.39,28.57142857142857,,,81.51750972762646,2,0.5,50.538146192329066,63.44185116731518,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.8138888999999985,71.76666679999998,55.0,68.51205537019456,22.0,Power,52.88375827658756,sa3022866,playerId

Sensing an opportunity, the Brewers swooped in the sixth round and eventually signed the young infielder for $1.35 million, roughly second-round money. Pratt was an All-Star Futures Game selection and a Carolina League All-Star in his first full season and finished with a .277/.362/.406 line with eight homers and 27 steals in 96 games between Single-A Carolina and High-A Wisconsin. He appeared in two postseason games for Double-A Biloxi closer to home and homered in one to round out a full 2024. Pratt didn’t whiff much at Single-A, backing up the bat-to-ball skills that made him such a notable Draft prospect in the first place. He’s more of a line-drive hitter at this early stage of his development, and he’s already shown a solid ability to yank liners to his pull side for doubles. Brewers officials noted with interest that he showed more power at the higher level with Wisconsin -- a possible combination of confidence, swinging with intent and physical maturation -- and given his size at 6-foot-4, there is the potential for average power at Pratt’s peak, though it hasn't showed up much with Biloxi in '25. A solid average runner, Pratt shows impressive timing and instincts at shortstop and was rewarded with a Gold Glove Award in his first campaign. His internal clock impressed many evaluators, and he has ample arm strength and arrow-like accuracy to throw out runners in a pinch. Those calm concerns that he’d need to head over to third base eventually while elevating Pratt’s ceiling as a potential solid regular.

At a projectable 6’4”, there is no doubt the raw juice is in there, and he also proved to be an excellent athlete (27 steals) with a strong plate approach (20.0/10.3 K%/BB%). The plate approach was much better at Single-A than High-A, and some of that was certainly because he was trying to get to more of his power. So he’s not a finished product, but the ingredients are in here to be an impact across the board fantasy player. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 80/23/80/.262/.328/.453/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5871559633027523,0.3761467889908257,0.6100917431192661,0.42201834862385323,0.8348623853211009,55.65,89.28571428571429,78.57142857142857,,81.1284046692607,3,0.75,76.56739446751463,62.97108806363012,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.066666699999999,86.80000039999999,70.0,62.51882647908904,17.0,Contact,56.94347199559007,sa3022867,playerId

The younger brother of Padres infielder Eguy Rosario, he stood out with his physicality and raw tools on the showcase circuit, though he also was dogged by swing-and-miss issues and lasted until the Cubs took him in the sixth round. He finished fourth in the Single-A Carolina League in both homers (16) and strikeout rate (32 percent) in his first full pro season before Chicago traded him to the Guardians for Eli Morgan in November. Rosario is a study in extremes as a right-handed hitter. On the positive side, he has more bat speed and strength and generates more raw power and higher exit velocities than most 20-year-olds. But he's also overly aggressive, tries to launch every pitch he sees to his pull side and struggles to recognize or deal with non-fastballs. Rosario's big swing slows him down coming out of the batter's box, but he can flash well above-average speed once he gets going and he knows how to use it on the bases. His quickness gives him a chance to remain in center field if he can hone his defensive instincts. If not, his plus-plus arm strength is perfect for right field.

The hit tool is the real problem though with .229 BA and 25.9% K% in 102 games at High-A, and it got way worse after the trade to Tampa with a 34.6% K% in 31 games. He’s an excellent athlete with power and speed, but his K rates have been very high in the lower minors, which is not a great sign for an advanced college bat. If anyone can make it work, it’s Tampa, but often a guy like this ends up in a part time role for them in their mid to late 20’s, which is only so helpful for fantasy. Still a decent upside shot though if the hit tool can improve. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 54/16/56/.233/.309/.422/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8289473684210527,0.8552631578947368,0.5526315789473685,0.7894736842105263,0.6447368421052632,74.49,,,,29.37743190661478,1,0.25,22.767509727626454,56.38712840466926,1.0,2–4 yr,0.9888888000000016,38.13333439999998,40.0,63.60563868140078,36.888888000000016,Contact,38.715871086630344,sa3022885,playerId

I’m still not seeing huge fantasy upside as he doesn’t hit the ball all that hard, he doesn’t run much, and while the glove is solid, it’s not so good that it is going to force him on the field.

Shaw spent all of 2024 in the Florida Complex League, where he hit .220/.361/.304 in 51 games, and he has opened his age-20 season strongly with Single-A Dunedin in his first dip into full-season ball. Shaw uses a stout, springy left-handed stance to get the barrel on balls when he decides to fire. He has a tremendous eye for someone with his age and experience, running high walk totals everywhere he goes. With low swing rates, however, he could run into danger of being overly passive against more experienced arms with better command. While he doesn’t post high exit velocities, he’s helped his slugging numbers take a jump in ’25 by pulling the ball in the air more and turning catchable fly balls into more stung line drives. Listed at 5-foot-10, Shaw is an average runner and got all his defensive reps in the outfield (primarily left) in ’24. He moved to second base this season but showed he still had defensive development ahead of him, particularly when it comes to throwing strongly and accurately from the keystone. The Blue Jays moved him back to the grass after a second-half promotion to High-A. Shaw profiles best as a bat-first option off a Major League bench who could cover a few different positions in a pinch.

The Blue Jays selected him 20th overall, making him the highest first-generation Indian-American ever drafted in the four major sports, and signed him for $3 million. With short-season ball limited to the complex, Toronto faced a decision on where to open the shortstop in 2024 and chose Single-A Dunedin after his strong spring. Nimmala hit just .167 with a 34.4 percent strikeout rate through 29 games, and the organization did an in-season reset in mid-May. After he returned to the Florida State League on June 27, he took off with a .265/.331/.564 line and 13 homers in his final 53 games. Nimmala’s 17 homers total led all players aged 18 or younger in 2024, and his FSL exit velocity data was solid for the level regardless of age, underlining that he could get to plus power at maturity. Blue Jays coaches noted that he wasn’t always putting himself in the best posture to make the most of that strength in the season’s first half and worked to correct it, leading to much better numbers on pitches inside the zone after his in-season break. Nimmala can still be vulnerable to soft stuff as he grows more accustomed to pro pitching. The Florida native can be a solid runner but may slow down as he grows into his large frame. He made gains with his defensive instincts and range at shortstop, and while he isn’t always smooth there, his plus arm strength can help paper over issues. Nimmala will still only be 19 for the entire 2025 season and cemented his place among the game's most interesting prospects.

He slashed .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers, 5 steals, and a 29.7/6.4 K%/BB% in his last 53 games. He has one of the sweetest righty swings in the game that is tailored made to launch the ball to the moon with a 46.6% FB%. It’s powerful too with a 89.1 MPH EV, and at a projectable 6’1”, there is only more power coming. He’s also a good athlete who should contribute in steals even if he isn’t a huge base stealer. The biggest issue is clearly the hit tool, but you have to give him some leeway for his age, and the upside is high enough to take on that extra risk. I have Nimmala grouped with Brandon Winokur and Eric Bitonti as tooled up power hitting beasts with hit tool risk in the back half of the Top 100 Prospects Rankings. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 77/28/89/.242/.321/.473/14",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.34210526315789475,0.8421052631578947,0.35526315789473684,0.631578947368421,0.5921052631578947,52.51,91.66666666666666,77.77777777777779,93.33333333333333,82.10116731517509,4,1.0,85.09651967142239,63.91528188499784,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.7277777999999984,82.73333359999998,85.0,60.46508460549936,12.0,Contact,58.95595479247471,sa3022892,playerId

That enabled them to get Jenkins, one of the two top high school hitters in the class, and he quickly hit his way to full-season ball, whetting the Twins' appetites with a .988 OPS during his pro debut. A quad strain slowed him early and he missed six weeks at the start of the season with a hamstring injury, but the North Carolina native still managed to play his way to Double-A in his first full year. Jenkins has every chance to be a plus hitter with plus power in time. He turns around velocity with a smooth left-handed swing, recognizes spin well and can hit the ball a long way to all fields. He doesn't swing and miss much and draws walks, making consistent hard contact. Once he literally got his legs under him following his injuries, the Twins saw what he could do with a .303/.404/.494 line in July and August. There's plenty more power for him to get to in games as he gets more reps. There may be a time when it makes more sense for Jenkins to slide over to right field, where his plus arm and offensive game profile very well. But he's an above-average runner whose plus instincts are an asset in center field, so there's no reason to move him permanently, even if he gets more exposure in the corners so there are options to get his bat into the lineup in the big leagues soon.

Tucker had 9 homers with 32 steals and a 16.3/10.1 K%/BB% in 117 games in the lower minors, while Jenkins had 6 homers with 17 steals and a 12.8/15.2 K%/BB% in 82 games. Like Jenkins, Tucker also wasn’t a burner, and nobody really expected the steal totals to stick in the majors, but they did. And like Jenkins, the only thing that hadn’t fully developed yet was the power, but Tucker had a monster power explosion the very next season, hitting 25 homers in 120 games split between High-A and Double-A. I see no reason why Jenkins can’t have that same power explosion at 6’3”, 210 pounds with one of the sweetest lefty swings this game has ever seen. He doesn’t hit the ball on the ground too much and he can pull it, so while his hard hit numbers weren’t too impressive, they weren’t too bad either, and it would be pretty shocking if he didn’t develop impact power. He’s on a beeline for elite dynasty asset, and he’s among the favorites to be the #1 prospect in baseball by the middle of 2025. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 103/27/96/.282/.365/.504/18",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9166666666666666,0.5833333333333334,0.9305555555555556,0.6388888888888888,0.625,77.24,100.0,100.0,,98.44357976653697,3,0.75,91.90718699931334,82.37351544975967,1.0,0–1 yr,-5.5694444999999995,100.0,70.0,82.1940546349279,17.0,OBP,68.43732458571755,sa3022894,playerId

They didn’t have to wait much longer, selecting McGonigle 37th overall and signing him to an above-slot deal at $2,847,500. The Pennsylvania native got a taste of Single-A action that summer and returned to the Florida State League to begin 2024. He dominated for Lakeland with a slash line of .326/.407/.470 and a 24/35 K/BB ratio in 60 games before being pushed to High-A West Michigan in late July. McGonigle suffered a fractured right hamate and underwent surgery in mid-August, cutting his first full season short. Batting from the left side, McGonigle coils himself tightly in the box to turn on pitches. He didn’t whiff on more than 12 percent of his swings against any major pitch types in the FSL, and his 8.5 percent K rate at both levels was sixth-best among 1,081 Minor Leaguers with at least 300 plate appearances in 2024. He won’t expand the zone much either, and pitchers typically paid the price when they came into the zone where McGonigle ran a 93.6 percent contact rate in the FSL. His strong exit velocities backed up the hope that he’ll have at least average power, and he's been a doubles machine as he's climbed the ladder into the upper Minors in 2025. McGonigle can burst out of the box nicely with above-average speed, and he gives pitchers and catchers something to monitor when on base. He's been basically exclusive to shortstop in 2025, but many evaluators still believe he’s a better overall fit at second base over the long term. McGonigle’s hit tool has placed him on the map in a big way, making him the top piece in a talent-rich Tigers system.

He slashed .309/.401/.452 with 5 homers, 22 steals, and a 8.5/14.0 K%/BB% in 74 games split between Single-A and High-A. He proved he wasn’t just hit tool though, hitting the ball pretty hard with a 88.9 MPH EV at Single-A, and also showing base stealing skills (22 for 24 on the bases). He didn’t have any groundball issues and he pulled the ball a lot (well over 50% pull rate). Even during the regular season I got too locked into him as a hit tool guy, when there is more to his skillset than that. He’s not a particularly big guy at 5’10”, 187 pounds, and I still see more of a moderate power/speed combo, so I still don’t mind my Stevan Kwan 2.0 comp, but McGonigle is already hitting the ball harder (and pulling the ball a lot more), so he can end up a souped up version of Kwan. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 92/15/58/291/.362/.422/21",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9908256880733946,1.0,0.981651376146789,0.9908256880733946,0.926605504587156,98.25,100.0,100.0,,89.6887159533074,3,0.75,88.57261387045091,94.86291485465782,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.066666699999999,86.80000039999999,70.0,95.51637451639735,17.0,Power+OBP,71.79236861237881,sa3022895,playerId

The left-handed-hitting outfielder posted a 1.025 OPS, slugged 12 homers and stole 17 bases while mostly playing center field for the Bulldogs. The Rays liked what they saw, drafted him in the second round and signed him for an under-slot bonus of $1.3 million. After a brief professional debut that year, he spent all of 2024 with High-A Bowling Green and put together an .822 OPS with 16 homers in 109 games. Ledbetter’s game is pretty steady across the board, with no real standout tools. His swing-and-miss tendencies have increased in pro ball, but he has shown a feel for hitting wherever he’s been, with a relatively compact swing and an all-fields approach. He has the bat speed and strength -- he's listed at 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds -- to generate pull-side power, especially against right-handed pitchers. Of his 16 homers for Bowling Green, 14 were off right-handers, and his OPS was 128 points higher against righties. Ledbetter also demonstrated some value on the bases in his full-season debut, despite not being a burner, as he stole 34 bags while only being caught seven times. Ledbetter is athletic enough to handle center, albeit perhaps not at the Rays’ lofty standard for defense at that position, but his fringy arm strength could force him to a corner – which he should be able to handle well -- as he moves through a system featuring a handful of elite defensive outfielders. Playing a corner will put more pressure on his bat, and his performance at the plate will determine whether he can be a regular or perhaps a strong platoon option.

He hits the ball in the air a ton with a 28.6% GB%, and he’s always been an excellent base stealer with some speed.

He would’ve been the fastest player in the 2020 Draft class had he not been intent on attending Vanderbilt, where he spent three years racking up 130 steals as one of the NCAA’s most dynamic leadoff men. Now he is one of the Minors’ fastest players and premier basestealing threats, and his ability to cause havoc on the basepaths draws him comparisons to former Gold Glover and stolen base champion Kenny Lofton. That skill set compelled the Orioles to take Bradfield No. 17 overall in the 2023 Draft, and he signed for a full-slot bonus of $4.17 million before enjoying a nice debut. He then blossomed in his first full pro season, stealing 74 bases in 108 games -- the second-highest total in the Minors -- and finished the year at Double-A. Bradford’s 80-grade speed allows him to do things on the basepaths few runners can, making him a headache for pitchers and catchers alike. All those steals in college came with a 90.9 percent success rate and he stole 99 bases in his first 133 pro games while sporting a fine 86.8 percent success rate. His quickness also allows him to cover large swaths of ground in center field, where his ability to track down well-struck gappers makes him an elite defender despite a below-average arm. He is a left-handed hitter with a flat swing and a good bunter whose offensive upside hinges on his ability to make contact, manage the strike zone well and tap into his polished on-base skills. He walked more than he struck out both in his brief pro debut and during his first crack in Double-A, albeit in small samples, while swinging and missing at pitches only 5.3 percent of the time in 2024. With game-changing wheels and a slender frame, Bradford will never be a slugger. But he can be an impact offensive player if he consistently hits line drives rather than rely on his legs to turn ground balls into infield hits. To that end, he slashed his ground-ball rate by 16.5 percent in ‘24 without succumbing to major swing-and-miss, and his plate discipline should allow him to get on base enough to be a disruptive force at the top of the lineup. Bradford has one of the highest floors in the Orioles' system thanks to his elite speed and Gold Glove potential, with the ceiling of an elite table-setter if he continues to develop offensively and learns to tap into his top tools.

He proved everything will transfer to Double-A in the last 27 games of the season, slashing .287/.395/.396 with 1 homer, 15 steals, and a 11.7/12.5 K%/BB%. He’s a good CF, the contact rates are excellent (although they weren’t as good at High-A with a 16.6% K% in 81 games), he gets on base, and he’s a demon on the bases. He’s a CF version of Xavier Edwards, and with Cedric Mullins hitting free agency after this year, it wouldn’t be crazy at all to see Bradfield winning the CF job in 2026 and beyond. – 2025 Projection: 19/0/7/.248/.298/.334/8 Prime Projection: 77/6/44/.278/.336/.369/43",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,95,0.4027777777777778,0.2222222222222222,0.6180555555555556,0.2638888888888889,0.6111111111111112,41.94,89.65517241379311,0.0,,71.40077821011673,3,0.75,51.58677713672346,45.31637199785321,1.0,0–1 yr,-2.355555599999999,78.26666719999999,70.0,48.40191167935596,17.0,OBP,48.88419369571018,sa3022917,playerId

He was selected in the third round by the Rays that summer and didn’t disappoint in his first full season of pro ball, slashing .324/.408/.483 with 10 homers, 20 steals and an even 48/48 K/BB ratio over 100 games across three levels, including Double-A Montgomery. He was an All-Star Futures Game pick and finished out the year with a .338 average and an .891 OPS over 19 games in the Arizona Fall League. Using a puck knob bat and a choked-up grip, Morgan hits like a player anemic to the K. He stays balanced to cover plenty of the plate, and when he gets into a two-strike count, he spreads out wide and eliminates a leg kick to keep things as short to the ball as possible. His 11 percent strikeout rate was seventh-lowest among 628 Minor Leaguers with at least 400 plate appearances in 2024, but it's nearly doubled at Triple-A in 2025. By his own admission, his power comes more from the gaps than over-the-fence, but he’ll run into the occasional homer. From LSU to Tampa Bay, anyone who watches Morgan’s soft hands and quick reactions at the cold corner comes away thinking he could win multiple Gold Gloves there. As is their wont, the Rays got him some time in the outfield to expand his versatility, but he’s such a good fit defensively at first it might be best to leave him there. Rays officials say they aren’t worried about Morgan’s lack of power diminishing his value at first base and are willing to let him be himself given the plus tools in the rest of the profile.

There isn’t high upside here with a moderate power/speed combo at best, so seeing him immediately struggle harder than he ever has the first time he faced advanced competition isn’t great. Don’t get me wrong, I still think he can be a solid MLB bat, but if the hit tool is only good and not great, I just don’t see how he can be a true impact fantasy player. He also struggled hard vs lefties (.521 OPS), so especially with Tampa, it looks likely he will be in a platoon role. This blurb ended up being much more negative than even I expected, because at the end of the day, I do believe this guy is going to hit at any level.

The K% exploded to 36.8% (.194 BA), but he still knocked out 6 homers with 3 steals and a 113 wRC+ in 30 games. He’s a lift and pull machine, so even without big raw power, he can hit dingers, and he’s not a burner, but he’s been a really good base stealer at every stop of his career. It’s the hit tool that is the real problem, and while I’m sure he will be better his second time around in the upper minors, it’s still not a good sign for what his hit tool will look like in the majors. A high K rate with mediocre EV’s and lots of flyballs is a recipe for a very low BA. It’s still a fantasy friendly skillset with pedigree (19th overall pick) and strong production at every stop of his career, so while I can’t call him a truly coveted prospect, I still like him. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 78/20/76/.242/.325/.435/15",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1559633027522936,0.46788990825688076,0.11926605504587157,0.11926605504587157,0.15596330275229353,21.17,,,,77.04280155642024,1,0.25,59.708171206225686,34.65835992217899,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.8277777999999998,59.9333336,40.0,31.031008016653693,27.0,Contact,29.900620327494163,sa3022921,playerId

He landed in the first round with the Mariners in 2023, the third straight year the club took a high school hitter with its first selection. His first full season was a success in that he reached High-A just after his 19th birthday, even though an oblique injury early and a fractured foot suffered in May limited him to 70 games. He made up for lost time with a dozen strong games in the Arizona Fall League, though a minor hamstring issue ended his stay early. Owner of the best hit tool in the Mariners system, Emerson got multiple votes in MLB Pipeline’s annual executive poll as being the best pure hitter in the Minors. He has a smooth and repeatable left-handed swing that enables him to find the barrel and make consistent hard contact. His .419 on-base percentage entering 2025 is a sign of his advanced approach as he’s walked nearly as often as he has struck out thus far in his career, and he rarely chases. He hasn’t really started to tap into his raw power with a hit-first approach, but his bat speed and strength point to at least average pop in the future. A former all-state wide receiver on the gridiron, Emerson isn’t a burner, but his athleticism shows up on both sides of the ball. He has excellent instincts on the basepaths that allowed him to go 15-for-17 in stolen base attempts in 2024, and he has good actions and enough arm for shortstop. He’s gotten reps at third and second as well, with some thinking he might eventually be best suited for the hot corner long term.

He has high groundball rates and he doesn’t pull the ball all that much, leading to only 4 homers in 70 games split between Single-A and High-A. It’s also not a Jackson Merrill situation where the guy smashes the ball. Emerson can hit it hard, but he’s not putting up gaudy EV’s. He’s also not a burner with average speed. So it’s a hit tool first profile, and like many hit tool first profiles, the hit tool can start to take steps back against more advanced pitching, which is what happened this year. He put up a .263 BA on the season, and the 21.6/10.8 K%/BB% in 29 games at High-A isn’t super impressive. A scenario where he ends up with a good, but not great hit tool, to go along with a moderate power/speed combo, definitely seems to be one possible outcome here. I’m only painting with a negative brush to start because I think it’s more interesting. We know what a positive outcome can look like, which is that both the raw and game power ticks up over time, the plate skills remain plus to double plus, and the base stealing ability is legit (15 steals in 17 attempts). And keep in mind he was only 18 years old for most of the season. This is a high floor/high ceiling prospect in the mold of your Wander Franco’s. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 99/22/72/.284/.362/.455/22",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7916666666666666,0.6388888888888888,0.7916666666666666,0.7222222222222222,0.7916666666666666,74.9,100.0,100.0,,95.13618677042801,3,0.75,90.64745937285419,80.41161078049896,1.0,0–1 yr,-5.988888899999999,100.0,70.0,80.3184832341497,17.0,Power+OBP,67.59331745536737,sa3022923,playerId

He was a solid performer in his first full season and finished second in the Florida State League in average (.288) and on-base percentage (.368) while placing fourth in OPS (.767) over 84 games. Baro rounded out the year with 11 contests with High-A Brooklyn. Standing in the box at 6-foot-even, Baro runs a loose and easy operation as a left-handed hitter, starting with a slightly open stance while looking to jump on balls. He didn’t expand the zone often in the FSL and found the barrel well on pitches inside the zone, helping the belief he’ll be at least an average hitter. Baro didn’t stand out for his pop, however, topping out with a 104.4 mph exit velocity with St. Lucie, but there’s still a good amount of projectability in his frame. He could shoot balls harder if he’s a late bloomer as some scouts expect. Baro is expected to be an average runner by the time he reaches the Majors, and he’s shown good defensive actions as an infielder. The Mets were loaded on the dirt in the lower levels, causing him to move around with stops at shortstop, third base and second. He’d be even more valuable up the middle, though he has the arm strength for the hot corner, and New York officials plan to give him plenty of looks at the four and six, especially as he proves himself with the stick.

New York slowrolled it with Ewing out of the gate in his first full season with an opening in the Florida Complex League, but he proved he was too good for the Rookie-level circuit quickly with a .422 on-base and .571 slugging percentage through 19 games. Ewing joined Single-A St. Lucie in June and got off to a rough start, but he managed a .277/.419/.436 line with three homers in 27 games from Aug. 1 onward. Measuring in at 5-foot-11, the left-handed-hitting Ewing didn’t expand the zone much, even during the tough times in the Florida State League. His final chase rate ranked in the 83rd percentile for the Single-A circuit despite his youth in his age-19 campaign. He did struggle against breaking stuff even in the zone, however, and that led to a 29.1 percent strikeout rate over his 71 FSL games. He's done a much better job at making contact in 2025, leading to a breakout at both St. Lucie and High-A Brooklyn. Ewing can run into balls with solid exit velocities, and he has enough pullside pop that he could be average in the power category in time. Ewing can really get going underway with impressive Sprint Speeds, and he should be a threat to opposing defenses on balls put in the gaps. Initial questions about Ewing’s arm strength -- along with a loaded middle-infield group in the lower Minors -- pushed the Buckeye State native to center field, where he can better make use of his wheels, but his arm can work from the grass for now. He’ll still mix in second base and the corner spots occasionally, but his value is in center where the Mets are pleased with how his athleticism has translated at this early stage.

They also took three straight prep bats that year, following Emerson with Jonny Farmelo and then Peete, all taken in the Top 30 picks. Peete signed for a little under slot, $2.5 million, and the former Georgia two-way standout split his brief pro debut between the Arizona Complex League and full-season Modesto as he focused on hitting only. He spent his first full season back with Modesto and showed flashes of the tools that made him a top prospect, but also inconsistencies that need to be addressed. A premium athlete with a wide receiver's 6-foot-2 frame, Peete has a left-handed swing geared to do damage at the plate. He has immense raw power and showed flashes of it in 2024, with an approach that could let him crush balls to all fields. But he just as easily can get out of that approach when he tries to sell out for power, and while he does draw some walks, the 30.7 percent strikeout rate he registered last year isn't going to work as he moves up the ladder. He doesn't have great rhythm and feel at the plate and could be an ambush power-over-hit type of offensive player. Peete uses his speed well on the basepaths, and he finished second in the California League with his 45 steals. He's seen time at shortstop, third base and in the outfield, and he might fit best in center long-term, as the game can speed up on him on the dirt.

He also already has a pretty strong season at Single-A under his belt with a .269/.343/.408 triple-slash in 115 games. That is a pretty good slash for an 18 year old in full season ball. He hit only 7 homers, but all 7 of them came in his final 59 games, which is the improvement you want to see from a young player as the season goes along. And he has no joke raw power at 6’2”, 193 pounds, so there is a lot more of that coming. He’s a really good athlete and he displayed elite base stealing ability with 45 steals in 50 attempts. What I’m trying to say, is that Peete is getting mighty underrated right now. I understand why he’s getting rated so low, because the hit tool is a legit problem with a 30.7% K%, but he walked 10.4% of the time too, and you have to take into account his young age for the level. There is definitely still a lot of rawness to his game, but he performed pretty well despite that rawness, so imagine what he can do as he starts to refine his game.

His performances there established him as one of the best offensive prospects in the prep class, and he signed for an under-slot $2.5 million as the 23rd overall pick in the 2023 Draft, joining Hank Conger and Nick Pratto as first-rounders out of Huntington Beach (Calif.) HS. He slashed .231/.347/.385 with 11 homers in 101 games during his full-season debut between two Class A levels, posting a 131 wRC+ in Single-A at age 19. Velazquez's most obvious tool is his power, the product of the bat speed in his left-handed swing and the strength in his 6-foot-3 frame. He lets his pop come naturally rather than swinging for the fences, and he has good feel for driving balls in the air, so he could become a 30-homer threat if he learns to turn on pitches more frequently. He's not just a masher, showing the ability to recognize pitches and work counts at a young age. While the Guardians drafted Velazquez as a catcher, they decided to maximize the value of his bat and made him a full-time first baseman in 2024 -- the exact opposite move they made with Bo Naylor in a similar situation. He's a well-below-average runner with limited range and so-so hands at first base, though he does have more arm strength than most at the position. He saw brief action in left field last summer but doesn't cover much ground out there.

He cracked 10 homers with a 20.1/15.0 K%/BB% and 131 wRC+ in 82 games. He struggled when he got to High-A with a 54 wRC+ in 19 games, but considering he started the year as an 18 year old, that isn’t a big deal. Cleveland moved him off catcher to 1B, which isn’t surprising and is a good thing for fantasy. One of the reasons I loved him so much last off-season was because when a smart team takes a 1B prospect so high (23rd overall), you know they absolutely love the bat, and at 6’3”, 215 pounds with a smooth and powerful lefty swing, it’s hard not to love his bat. He profiles as a classic middle of the order slugger. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 84/30/92/.258/.345/.500/6",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8899082568807339,0.944954128440367,0.5963302752293578,0.963302752293578,0.6513761467889908,81.6,61.904761904761905,57.14285714285714,,83.07392996108949,3,0.75,64.02934909372308,75.45027218280308,1.0,1–2 yr,-3.8444445000000016,96.13333400000002,70.0,81.93508175484092,17.0,Power,67.54745358967843,sa3023013,playerId

He won High-A Midwest League MVP honors by hitting .314/.433/.500 in 68 games before a promotion to Double-A, where he batted .281/.379/.416 in 25 contests. He led all Minor League catchers in wRC+ (160), on-base percentage (.419) and BB/K ratio (1.2). Like most of Cleveland's best position prospects, Ingle controls his barrel and the strike zone extremely well. A left-handed hitter, he rarely chases or swings and misses, making consistent contact and getting on base at a high clip. He's not very physical and makes a lot of groundball contact, which limits his power upside, though the Guardians have had him add a leg kick and hunt for pitches to drive early in counts, which could result in 12-15 homers on an annual basis. Quicker and more agile than most catchers, Ingle can flash solid speed out of the batter's box but is more of a fringy runner on the bases and could slow down as he spends more time behind the plate. He has good hands, committing just one passed ball in 74 games last year, and boosts his below-average arm strength with a quick release that helped him throw out 26 percent of basestealers in 2024. He lacks physicality at 5-foot-10 and 190 pounds, so there are some concerns about him handling a starter's workload at the big league level.

There isn’t big power or speed and he’s not a particularly good defensive catcher.

A Florida prep product, George Jr. signed for an over-slot $3.3 million as the 26th overall pick in the 2023 Draft. He slashed .231/.338/.334 with 32 extra-base hits and 39 steals in 110 games between two Class A stops during his first full pro season, spending the final month in High-A at age 19. Not only does Lombard feature the potential for solid or better tools across the board, he has the high baseball IQ to make the most of them. He possesses a sound right-handed stroke, recognizes pitches well and uses the entire field, so he's equipped to hit for average. He had surprising issues making contact against in-zone fastballs last year but tightened that hole up as he gained more experience. He has more bat speed and strength than most players his age, which already gives him plus raw power that he'll tap into more often as he learns to lift balls in the air more frequently. Lombard looks to make things happen on the bases with his solid speed and savvy. His instincts are even more apparent at shortstop, where he has smooth actions and covers plenty of ground to both sides. His quick hands and strong arm add to his defensive profile, and he also looked comfortable at second base last year -- though there's no doubt he'll stay at short.

A large chunk of his value was coming from that hit tool, because he doesn’t have big present power with only 5 homers in 110 games. The launch and approach are geared more for line drives than homers, so it’s not just about gaining more power naturally, which he will. He has good tools at 6’3”, 190 pounds and there is definitely room to tack on more mass. He’s also fast and a good baserunner with 39 steals. He has a mature approach (12.3% BB% with a .338 OBP), he’s a good defensive SS, and he’s young for his class at a still 19 years old as of 2025 Opening Day.

That selection, No. 29 overall, was used on Farmelo, a super-toolsy Virginia high schooler who was headed to the University of Virginia until the Mariners swooped in and went over-slot to sign him for $3.2 million. He was making a very strong first impression during his pro debut with Single-A Modesto in 2024 when he tore his right ACL in June, ending his year after just 46 games. Despite the injury, which should keep him out until around midseason in 2025, Farmelo opened a lot of eyes both within the organization and from other teams’ evaluators. His carrying tool was his potentially double-plus speed that allowed him to steal 18 bases in his abbreviated season, but now it remains to be seen if he gets all of that explosiveness back post injury. Using very unorthodox swing mechanics, Farmelo displayed an advanced approach, taking walks and making good swing decisions from the left side of the plate while showing he was already getting to some of his impressive raw power. The Mariners thought he was more power-over-hit when he first joined the organization, but there’s more confidence it’s leveled out a little. Farmelo’s speed is an asset in the outfield as well, and he should be at least an above-average defender in center field for a long time. The track record for young players coming back from this injury is pretty good, and the Mariners are banking on Farmelo’s plus makeup for him to return to the emerging star he looked like before he went down.

It was a non contact injury while tracking a line drive to centerfield. A lot of the excitement around him was due to his double plus speed and elite athleticism, so a torn knee kinda takes a shot directly to that strength. We’ve also seen guys tear their knee, and then keep tearing their knee again (or tear their other knee), like Kyle Lewis, Royce Lewis, and Ronald Acuna. On the flip side, we see NFL running backs return from torn ACL’s and get their explosion back, so at only 20 years old, I’m expecting Farmelo to retain most of his elite athleticism, but it’s certainly not good. And the injury is also expected to keep him out until mid-season 2025. So it could be hard for him to truly get the hype fully rolling again until 2026. Even with all that, I remain high on him because his upside is no joke. He slashed .264/.398/.421 with 4 homers, 18 steals, and a 23.5/16.3 K%/BB% in 46 games at Single-A. He’s 6’2”, 205 pounds with a powerful lefty swing and low groundball rates (34.1% GB%). He was thought to be on the raw side coming out of the draft, and while there is still hit tool risk, he showed a good feel to hit with an excellent approach in his debut. Assuming full health, he could be a beast, and even with the injury risk (and also the general risk of being a 19 year old in the lower minors), he should be considered a pretty sought after dynasty prospect.

There are already rumors they are considering calling De Vries and Salas up in 2025, which is straight wild. It did work out for Jackson Merrill, so who am I to judge? Merrill was 20 years old of course while De Vries and Salas are 18, but I love to see a team pushing the limits and setting new upper standards on how fast a prospect can fly through the minors. And De Vries has the type of talent that just might be able to pull it off. He was sent straight to full season ball for his pro debut, and while it took him a few months to find his footing, he went gangbusters once he did, slashing .275/.400/.563 with 11 homers, 8 steals, and a 20.5/14.9 K%/BB% in his final 40 games. Even with the early struggles, he still put up a 116 wRC+ in 75 games which is just silly for a 17 year old. The thing that separates De Vries from Jenkins, Walcott and De Paula for me, is that there are zero questions about him getting to his raw power. He put up a 32.4% GB%, 49.3% FB%, and 49.5% Pull%. I fully believe those other guys will get to their raw power as well, don’t get me wrong, but De Vries seems to be one step ahead of them in that area. His season ended in mid August with a shoulder injury, but he played in the AFL, and while he didn’t play especially well, it’s still nice to see the shoulder isn’t an issue. He’s an elite prospect right now, and if he doesn’t end up at #1, he won’t be far off. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 91/31/99/.271/.353/.513/20",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7522935779816514,0.8715596330275229,0.6697247706422018,0.8532110091743119,0.5504587155963303,74.72,,,,98.63813229571986,1,0.25,76.44455252918289,75.32359338521401,1.0,1–2 yr,-5.213888900000001,100.0,40.0,78.69307801556421,27.0,Power+OBP,59.3618851070039,sa3023363,playerId

San Francisco pounced on him in the fourth round, just as they had done in 2008 with another slick-fielding college shortstop who stock fell after a down spring: Brandon Crawford. The Giants see a lot of parallels between the two, but Ahuna didn't get to show much in his 2024 pro debut after injuring his elbow and requiring Tommy John surgery. Crawford won four Gold Gloves with San Francisco and Ahuna has the same kind of defensive ability. He has smooth actions, outstanding body control, quick hands and a strong arm. If he doesn't hit enough to be a regular, his prowess with the glove and versatility would make him a useful utilityman. There are questions about Ahuna's bat because he sells out for power, letting his left-handed swing get too long and uphill while trying to pull every pitch he sees. He does have enough sneaky pop to translate into 15 homers per season, but he produces a lot of rolled-over grounders and struggles to make contact against non-fastballs. He has the quick first step and plus speed to steal bases but isn't especially daring in that regard.

He’s shown glimpses of his enormous potential, though he’s had trouble staying on the field. He missed out on making his pro debut after signing because of a Grade 2 hamstring injury and then had season-ending surgery last July to repair his left hamate, though he whetted everyone’s appetite by posting a .999 OPS despite nursing the hand issue over 32 games in the Arizona Complex League. A switch-hitter who will be just 19 for all of the 2025 season, Celesten is still figuring things out with his swing from both sides of the plate. It’s whippy with plenty of bat speed, and he’s a bit hit-over-power at present. While he doesn’t have a groundball-dominant swing, he did post a 64.9 percent groundball rate during his pro debut, with one area of focus being settling into more of a line-drive gap-to-gap look at the plate. There’s confidence he’ll learn to drive the ball more in the air as he matures. Once thought to have the potential to be one of the fastest players in the system, Celesten looks more likely to settle in as more of an above-average runner, perhaps a result of the hamstring issue. He has every chance to stick at shortstop, especially if he can master consistency in routine plays and throws. More than anything, he needs to stay on the field and a full, healthy season could catapult him up lists like this.

All of the explosive traits that made him such a hyped international prospect were fully present with an extremely athletic and powerful swing (particularly from the left side, but he dominated in 2024 with both swings) that already looks like an MLB swing. He’s an explosive athlete in general with plus speed, so seeing the excellent plate skills from the jump in pro ball is a big deal. He does have two blemishes on his profile preventing him from ranking even higher than this though. It’s the 2nd year in a row that an injury kept him out. A hamstring injury in 2023 wiped out his entire season, and a hamate injury that required surgery ended his season on July 23rd this year. The 2nd blemish is a 64.9% GB%, which is very extreme. Personally, I’m blinded by his extreme upside, and I’m apt to overlook the negatives. When a prospect has that type of upside, it almost never makes sense to trade them at this stage of their career. His value is pretty high right now, but I think he falls into the buy high range for me. Certainly don’t trade him, and see if you can get him included in a trade without seeming like you’re frothing at the mouth for him too much, because it could give his owner second thoughts if you come on too strong. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 88/25/86/.273/.344/.472/25",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6052631578947368,0.35526315789473684,0.6710526315789473,0.6052631578947368,0.4473684210526315,54.42,61.111111111111114,56.25,,93.57976653696498,3,0.75,67.57200748327865,59.02320261914753,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.6416666999999983,81.70000039999998,70.0,59.892960845744255,17.0,Contact,54.74183246058492,sa3023381,playerId

He helped Bourne win the Cape Cod League championship during a late-summer cameo in 2022 before hitting .353/.467/.620 and topping Florida juco players with 31 steals in 48 games as a sophomore the next spring. He gave up a Florida State commitment to sign for an over-slot $300,000 bonus in 2023, then won Red Sox Minor League defensive player of the year accolades in his first full pro season. Boston has helped Taylor improve his bat speed and strength since he turned pro, and his explosive left-handed swing generates high exit velocities. His pull-heavy mindset and uphill stroke allow him to turn on pitches and drive them in the air, contributing to his solid raw power. He makes good swing decisions but has a lot going on with his stroke and needs to improve his in-zone contact, especially against non-fastballs. If Taylor hits, he has the tools to be a star.

As a 20 year old, those K rates are really enough for him to not crack this list, but his talent demands we stay patient for at least one more year. He has a damn smooth, athletic and powerful lefty swing at 6’2”, 188 pounds that most certainly looks the part of a major leaguer. Even with the high strikeout rates, he still performed pretty well with 8 homers, 6 steals, a .391 OBP, and a 108 wRC+ on the season. He was considered a bit more on the raw side when he was drafted, so some of this hit tool risk was expected. He’s clearly never going to be an “age to level” guy, but his talent isn’t going anywhere, and if he can figure out the hit tool in his mid 20’s, there could be a big payoff here. I’m inclined to buy super low, but make sure the price is actually super low. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 76/23/78/.235/.318/.434/14",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7162162162162162,0.7567567567567568,0.7432432432432432,0.6891891891891891,0.2702702702702703,66.96,,,50.0,43.3852140077821,2,0.5,38.564202334630345,57.02147081712062,1.0,2–4 yr,-0.07222229999999996,50.8666676,55.0,61.564441385136185,22.0,OBP,45.57733214331128,sa3023545,playerId

But development isn't always the straight line teams desire it to be and Sanchez, who signed for $2.7 million in January of 2024, really struggled in the DSL, finishing his debut summer with a .216/.356/.345 line. Sanchez still has plenty of projection and physical ability that he needs to learn how to use consistently. He entered pro ball with the reputation of having a simple left-handed swing that can produce hard contact and a solid approach. He's shown some loft in his swing with more gap power now, but the thinking was more would come with maturation. He needs to learn to get his bat into a better position so he can stay through the zone and be on time more consistently which would help him reduce his nearly 34 percent strikeout rate during his debut. After getting most of his defensive reps in center field during his debut, Sanchez will keep playing there and right field mostly going forward. He's an average runner but has good instincts in the outfield, giving him the chance to stick up the middle depending on how much he slows down. For now, he'll try to hit the reset button for 2025.

He’s a projectable 6’2”, 180 pounds and he didn’t have any major groundball or pull issues with a 35.4% flyball percentage and a 49% Pull%, so the game power should tick up naturally over time as the raw power starts coming in.

The Venezuela native spent his first season in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League with modest results (.219/.359/.356 line, two homers in 44 games) before returning in 2025 with a stronger showing, albeit after a delayed start. Standing 6 feet tall, the right-handed slugger drew praise for his bat-to-ball skills and advanced approach as an amateur, and that continues to be the case in his age-18 season. He’s upped his line-drive rate and cut down on infield popups, fueling the improved performance over the first two months of his summer. The over-the-fence pop still isn’t quite there, and he’s still likely to end up hit-over-power. Rodriguez’s plus arm strength remains his best overall asset, and entering late July, he’d thrown out 30.8 percent of attempted basestealers in his second DSL go. He impressed with his early game-calling as he joined the professional ranks, and there are the raw pieces for him to become at least an average backstop in time. He’ll face tougher tests as he moves stateside, and as has been proven over and over again, a lot can happen with those who don the tools of ignorance as they climb the ladder.

He starred in center on his nation's 15-and-under World Cup team in 2022 and received the highest bonus ($1.5 million) in Miami's 2024 international class. After struggling in his pro debut last summer, he has looked much better in his return to the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. Cova has looked more confident at the plate in 2025 and is doing a better job of turning on pitches and driving them in the air. With his quick right-handed swing and projectable strength, he should develop at least average power. While he's not afraid to work counts and take walks, his strikeout rate has nearly doubled in his return to the DSL. Cova has plus speed and likes to use it on the bases, giving him 20-20 upside. He has the quickness and instincts to remain in center field, and his average arm could get stronger as his body does. Scouts give him high marks for his intelligence and maturity.

He hit 3 homers with 36 steals and a 10.0/15.3 K%/BB% in 55 games in the DSL. He only hit .239, but that was mostly due to bad BABIP luck, so I’m not too concerned about that considering the contact rates.

Signed for $1,897,500 as the top prospect in the Dodgers' crop, he broke into pro ball by winning MVP and top prospect accolades in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. He slashed .342/.478/.691 in 46 games and led the DSL in slugging, OPS (1.169), homers (14) and total bases (105). Morales already is extremely physical for an 18-year-old and still has room to add more strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. He hits the ball exceptionally hard for his age, already shows advanced feel for driving balls in the air to his pull side and possesses the patience to work counts to find a pitch he can punish. More than just a slugger, he has a smooth right-handed swing with plenty of bat speed and understands that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs. While Morales is athletic for his size and makes the most of his average speed on the bases, he could lose a step as he continues to mature physically. He has the hands and solid arm strength for shortstop but may not have the range if he can't maintain his present quickness. He may profile better at third base, where he saw brief action in his pro debut, and also may get a look at second base in the future.

He is a grown man at 6’3”, 180 pounds with a big righty swing that can punish a baseball. He combines that with a mature plate approach and a good feel to hit. It certainly looks like he can be a middle of the order beast, and he has the right team to get it out of him. He’s a definite target.” … and he more than came through as one of, if not the top DSL breakout, slashing .342/.478/.691 with 14 homers, 12 steals, and a 22.4/19.9 K%/BB% in 46 games. He’s a lift and pull machine and there is potential for double plus raw power at peak, meaning the home run upside here is elite. The swing is quick and athletic, and he’s a good athlete for his size too. Most places have Jesus Made over Emil Morales an easy call in Made’s favor, but I actually think it’s pretty damn close. Made has the hit tool and speed edge, but Morales has the game power and raw power edge, and often times that power edge can overcome all other flaws. A 22.4% K% is on the high side for the DSL, so I do agree that Made’s combo of floor and upside takes it, but I’m not 100% sure I’m making the right call there. Either way, I love both, and I really, really love Morales compared to his much cheaper price. – ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 86/33/98/.250/.338/.519/9",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9594594594594594,0.9324324324324325,0.9594594594594594,0.972972972972973,0.3513513513513513,87.62,77.77777777777779,82.35294117647058,,92.60700389105058,3,0.75,78.83734855046771,84.5460719926637,1.0,2–4 yr,-2.6611112000000006,81.9333344,70.0,85.84482175779912,17.0,Power+OBP,66.46683667100962,sa3023887,playerId

They added Andujar to the system when the 2024 signing period opened, giving him $1.7 million to sign. One of the top infielders in the class, he went to the Dominican Summer League for his pro debut and showed off some good contact skills, hitting .292 with a .376 on-base percentage, but leading to some concerns about future impact. One of the youngest players in the class who didn’t turn 17 until late July, Andujar certainly has time to figure things out. He starts out with a pretty good feel for hitting from both sides of the plate. He can find the barrel routinely and makes a ton of contact. He struck out just 13.5 percent of the time, isn’t afraid to hit behind in the count and even drew some walks. He needs to add strength so he can impact the ball more, even if power isn’t ever a big part of his game after slugging .352 in his debut. More strength should also augment Andujar’s speed. He likes to run despite having just average speed at present and he moves well defensively at shortstop. He has good hands and an arm that could develop into a plus for him at the premium position. His ability to slow the game down gives him an even better overall defensive package and something he can lean on to help his team win if his bat is slow to develop.

The young shortstop was the better performer out of the gate in the Dominican Summer League, hitting .310/.381/.468 with four homers and 27 steals in 49 games. He led qualified DSL Nats in average, slugging, isolated slugging (.158), hits (53) and doubles (nines) and tied for the lead in homers on his way to mid-season All-Star honors. At 6-foot-3 already so early in his development cycle, Feliz drew excitement for his projectable power potential when signing and already put it to use in the DSL, specifically to the pullside. The exit velocities should only get louder from here, and if he can use added strength to elevate more on contact, there’s even the possibility for above-average pop here in time. Concerns about the length of Feliz’s swing were quieted some with good contact rates, but he’ll face much tougher tests against stateside pitching. Feliz ran wild in the DSL but is expected to have below-average speed by the time he reaches the Majors. The Nationals have stuck to their word about intending to play him at shortstop as much as possible, but the thought that he might have to move over to third base eventually remains. His arm strength will fit there. But everything is trending well enough offensively that Feliz moved to Single-A Fredericksburg for a late-season came at the end of his age-18 season.

He offered some of the best raw power on that market but had difficulty getting to it in his pro debut. He batted just .196/.294/.345 with a 33 percent strikeout rate in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. Vilorio already is stronger and hits the ball harder than most 18-year-olds, and there's still room to add more strength to his 6-foot-4 frame. The bat speed he generates with his right-handed swing contributes to projections of plus-plus raw pop once he's fully developed. He has at least 30-homer upside, but he'll have to tone down his chase-heavy approach and make a lot more in-zone contact to succeed at the plate. With solid-to-plus speed and good instincts, Vilorio can steal a few bases and has a chance to remain in center field. He'll probably lose a step as he matures physically, which would dictate a move to the corners. His arm strength grades out as at least plus and easily would work in right field.

The younger brother of former big leaguer Dawel Lugo, Joswa made a strong first impression during his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League, slashing .301/.370/.466 with five homers and 18 steals, raising the excitement bar for his arrival stateside in 2025. A right-handed hitter with easy raw power, Lugo can make hard contact with the ability to drive the ball to all fields, even if most of his thump is showing up to his pull side thus far. The strikeout rate was a little higher than expected, just over 23 percent, coming mostly from his tendency to chase. He can get to a lot of pitches that he shouldn’t be swinging at, and that will be an area of focus in his development. He has as much offensive upside as any hitter in the system. An average runner right now, Lugo will play shortstop -- where he played exclusively in the DSL -- for as long as he can. While he has a strong arm and good hands, there’s a chance he outgrows the premium position and has to slide over to third base. The good news is he has the instincts to be really strong at the hot corner and could very well have the hitting profile to match.

He has power potential written all over him with a smooth and quick righty swing that already packs a major punch. He had no groundball issues with a 35.3% GB%, so he should be able to get to all of his power at peak. He’s also a really good athlete who is currently at SS, so while he’s likely to fill out and slow down over time, he should be at least be a contributor in stolen bases, along with a possible asset with the glove (or at least not a total nothing). The biggest red flag is that the K/BB rates were pretty weak against DSL competition, so there is still a ton of risk present here, but if he performs well when he comes stateside, he has the type of talent that can explode in a hurry.

There already was chatter that he was more talented than his bonus might indicate when he turned pro, and his debut did nothing to change that. He displayed one of the best combinations of power and hitting ability in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League, slashing .275/.393/.517 and ranking fourth with 10 homers in 48 games. Much stronger than his listed 5-foot-10 and 154 pounds, Level has a quick, fluid swing with some loft from both sides of the plate. He has advanced feel for the barrel and for the zone, forcing pitchers to throw him strikes and taking advantage when they do. His bat speed allows him to turn on pitches and he should develop 20-homer power once he learns to drive balls in the air more regularly. Level is a quick-twitch athlete with plus speed that he uses well on the bases. He has the actions and arm strength to remain at shortstop, though some scouts wonder if he might lose a step as he matures physically and wind up at second or third base. Center field is another possible option, and his bat should play anywhere.

Florentino and his $395,000 bonus was right in the middle of the pack. Like most signees these days after joining an organization in 2024, the big left-handed hitter made his debut in the Dominican Summer League and showed off some surprisingly advanced skills right out of the gate. The Pirates hope that Florentino will fill out his 6-foot-4 frame and learn to be an impact hitter as he moves through the system. It looks like he has a pretty good foundation already, with excellent bat speed and the ability to make a lot of impact, especially given his age. He doesn't miss fastballs, evaluators like his swing that already features some loft and he makes good swing decisions. Florentino walked more than he struck out during his debut, showing solid strike-zone judgement, and that continued as he made his way from the Florida Complex League to full-season ball in 2025. Long and lanky, Florentino is a better runner underway but has better than expected speed. He saw time in all three outfield spots and at first base during his debut, and while there were concerns he would fill out and slow down enough that a corner outfield post or first would be his only options, he's playing a lot of center field and looked better than than expected, giving him a chance to stick up the middle. He gets very high marks for his work ethic and character as he comes stateside at age 18.

That honor belongs to Quintana, who first joined the system for $1.7 million that January. Quintana was solid in the Dominican Summer League in his introduction to pro ball, and while the others moved up quickly to Single-A, he progressed more normally with a league-average season in the Arizona Complex League. Following the end of the ACL, he was traded to the Padres alongside Nestor Cortes for outfielder Brandon Lockridge. Quintana is the rare switch-hitter who’s shown pretty even splits from both sides at such an early stage in his career. He has decent bat-to-ball skills for his age, but as he fills out, he’s trending more toward becoming a power bat (and even homered against rehabbing Major Leaguer Aaron Ashby before the ACL season kicked off). He'll flash plus raw pop, and that could come out more with additional stateside experience. That would have value if he can remain at shortstop. He had even more focus at the six in his second full season while still sprinkling in some time at third base. There is the concern that he’ll slow down as he fills out that 6-foot-2 frame even more and head to the hot corner for good down the line. For now, he has enough speed to be a stolen-base threat with 19-plus thefts in each of his first two campaigns. Quintana will be in much less of a shadow in his new organization, and the Padres have a history of turning new acquisitions into even better prospects in time.

But one year later, he’s proven himself to be one of the best prospects in all of baseball. The switch-hitting infielder was a Dominican Summer League All-Star in his first taste of the pros and finished with a .331/.458/.554 line, six homers, 28 steals and an astounding 28/39 K/BB ratio in 51 games. Made’s underlying data made him really pop across the industry. He ran just a 15 percent chase rate and made contact on 89 percent of his swings, cementing his special plate discipline status. It’s one thing to make good swing decisions and another to pack some punch behind the hacks. Made did that too with a 47 percent hard-hit rate and 103.9 mph 90th-percentile exit velocity; the latter of which would put him in Jazz Chisholm Jr. and José Ramírez territory right now. And he did this at just 17 years old. Starting with a front foot slightly turned backward, Made can look like a spring unloading on contact, though the vast majority of his looks came from the left side in ’24. Defensively, Made – an above-average runner – got the lion’s share of his work at short but also saw time at third and second. His plus arm strength is a fit at the hot corner, and at this early stage, it’s still possible he slides over there full time down the line. For now, Milwaukee wants Made getting every opportunity to stick at the six and that would add another level to his already considerable ceiling, even with all the caveats of youth thrown in.

He has a mature plate approach and he has the potential to be a very good defensive SS. I know these international prospect blurbs can get repetitive especially as we get deep into the class, but these are the prospects that can blow up if you want upside. Embrace the mystery. Prime Projection: 76/24/81/.258/.334/.449/12.” And blow up Made did as one of the top breakouts in the DSL, slashing .331/.458/.554 with 6 homers, 28 steals, and a 13.0%/18.1% K%/BB% in 51 games. He’s projectable, he’s toolsy, he hits the ball hard, the plate approach is very strong, and he’s a good SS. That is the total package, and while there is still a lot of risk as DSL performance is the least trustworthy, there is also truly elite prospect upside. I know there are many leagues, usually shallower ones, where gunning for the top pure upside is the best strategy to take, but even in medium to deeper leagues, Made is worth the risk. And use Made as a reminder to not be afraid to dive into the mystery that is the international class as you get deeper into first year player drafts this off-season. That is why the last third of my Top 146 FYPD Rankings are always jam packed with these guys. Low upside, boring college guys just aren’t likely to be difference makers.

Montero's debut in the Dominican Summer League that summer was nothing to write home about (.239/.398/.375) and the A’s are trying to let their prospects have some success before moving them along, so he’s repeated the level in 2025. It seems like a good move as the infielder put up very impressive numbers in his second DSL stint. A switch-hitting shortstop, Montero has shown the ability to impact the ball from both sides of the plate, with his natural right-handed swing more direct to the ball, though his left-handed swing is more picturesque and he obviously gets more plate appearances from that side. He has the chance to hit for average and power, with a solid approach that has allowed him to walk more than he strikes out for much of the summer. Last year, Montero was slower and less athletic, but attention to conditioning and nutrition has helped him get leaner and stronger. An average runner, Montero has the instincts and actions to stick at shortstop for a long time, with a solid and accurate arm. If his body gets bigger as he matures -- he played all of 2025 at age 18 -- he could move to the hot corner, but the A’s don’t see that in his future. What they are hoping for is that he comes to instructs this year and stays in the United States as one of the better prospects to come out of their Dominican academy in some time.

Sanchez then had a standout debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2024, pairing 21 extra-base hits with a 1.037 OPS, though his unique situation did make him old for the circuit and his season was cut short due to an injury. A left-handed-hitting outfielder, Sanchez has tremendous raw power that he’s already showing an ability to tap into with both extra-base and over-the-fence authority, and because of the loft to his swing, he produced one of the lower ground-ball rates in the Orioles' system. The hit tool is less polished but he shows some strike zone recognition and ability to work counts, and it wouldn’t be surprising if he developed into an average hitter with above-average power. The bat is the carrying tool as Sanchez is just a fringe-average runner. Sanchez saw time at all three outfield positions during his debut, but his bat-first profile is best suited for a corner, possibly left field because the arm is just average. Based on his age and abilities, Sanchez is like an everyday corner outfielder starter set: he’ll need to refine his approach at the plate and show he can hit more advanced pitching, but his precocious ability to barrel pitches and hit the ball hard give him the ceiling of a middle-of-the-order run-producer.

But don’t sleep on another infield prospect from that same group in Peña, an $800,000 addition out of the Dominican Republic. Peña won the Dominican Summer League batting title with a .393 average while stealing 39 bags (tied for second-most in the DSL) and managing a 1/1 K/BB ratio over 44 games on his way to mid-season and post-season All-Star honors in the complex circuit. A right-handed batter, Peña starts from a slightly open stance but looks balanced and relaxed in the box, using a slight leg lift to stay on time. His bat-to-ball skills are impressive at such a young age, leading to just an 8.2 percent K rate in ’24, but he knows it and will expand the zone a bit to get to that contact. He hit only one home run last season, but his exit velocities have blossomed with his move to full-season ball in 2025. Peña has ample speed to burn and is aggressive on the basepaths. He’ll beat out grounders too -- part of the reason for his high .426 BABIP in the DSL -- and that will give future defenses plenty to consider. He moved around between shortstop, third base and even second because of the Brewers’ DSL depth at the six. His arm strength would play at third should he land there full-time. Peña may have to continue shifting around the dirt as he's moved aggressively alongside Made.

He’s not a big guy at a relatively skinny 5’11”, but he has an explosive righty swing that can hit the ball hard, there is plenty of room to tack on mass, and he doesn’t have any major lift and pull problems, so there is definitely potential for him to develop some level of real power down the line. If he can, that makes for a pretty exciting prospect with contact, speed and power. If he can’t, there should still be enough impact there for him to be a enticing hit/speed prospect. – ETA: 2029 Prime Projection: 82/15/64/.272/.331/.425/28",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7763157894736842,0.7763157894736842,0.5921052631578947,0.868421052631579,0.8947368421052632,76.32,96.42857142857143,92.85714285714286,,51.16731517509727,3,0.75,70.98557613706961,74.45295164797436,1.0,2–4 yr,-3.802777800000001,95.63333360000001,70.0,78.6568855343923,17.0,Contact,65.97226521047655,sa3024134,playerId

That's the most Cleveland has paid an international amateur since giving Gabriel E. Rodriguez $2.1 million six years earlier. Arias hit .247/.367/.347 during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League, ranking seventh in steals (29) and eighth in strikeout rate (8 percent). Arias recognizes pitches and controls the strike zone exceptionally well for an 18-year-old, allowing him to repeatedly find the barrel with a quick if unorthodox left-handed swing. He tends to slightly chop down on the ball, though he had no difficulty pulling pitches or lifting them in the air during DSL play. He'll need a lot of time to develop, but once he gets stronger and makes some adjustments, he could hit for a solid average while providing 15 or more homers per year. Arias has gotten a little faster since turning pro and now boasts well-above-average speed. He gets good jumps on the bases and in center field, and he definitely should cover enough ground to stay up the middle. He has average strength and gets to balls quickly, making it tough to run on him.

He debuted as a 17-year-old in the Dominican Summer League later that year, playing 45 games and slashing just .213/.330/.366. Ricardo only hit two homers and seven doubles but showed strong contact rates, only striking out at a 17.3% clip. Ricardo went into pro ball with reports of raw power he showed before signing, although that didn’t turn up much in the small DSL sample. The switch-hitter has a compact and efficient swing withn untapped power potential, but he’s shown good bat speed on both sides and is quick with his hands. The left-handed swing is a little more efficient and smooth, so the damage might come more from that side. He’s still very young and needs to add strength as he grows into his 6-foot-1 frame, but his contact rates and feel for the strike zone are promising. Defensively, Ricardo might outgrow shortstop, but he has the plus arm strength, hands and instinct to stick there for now. He’s athletic and should be able to handle second or third base if he needs to move. Ricardo came to Arizona in the fall for the Royals’ instructional league program and progressed over a few weeks there. He gets high marks for his makeup as a hard worker and good teammate. He got his first opportunity stateside in Rookie ball in 2025 and moved up to Single-A early after dominating the Arizona Complex League.

Only Yovanny Rodriguez ($2.85 million) signed for more in the organization last year. Making his pro debut in his home nation, Lantigua was arguably New York’s top performer in the Dominican Summer League as he slashed .263/.397/.395 over 45 games, giving him a 122 wRC+. The outfielder was named a DSL midseason All-Star and went 1-for-3 with a steal in the circuit’s version of the midsummer classic. As good as Lantigua’s first taste of the pros was, he still stands out more for his future projection than current skills. At 6-foot-1 and having turned 18 in November, he still has room to mature physically -- a great sign for a right-handed slugger who already produces strong top-end exit velocities. He took his fair share of walks against the typically wild DSL arms (and was even one of the most plunked players in the league with 14 HBPs) and kept strikeouts in check for his age and experience, but he’ll likely need to tighten his swing to keep that contact rate coming against more experienced arms. A solid runner now, Lantigua spent the bulk of his DSL time in center field. There’s always a chance he slows as he ages, and the Mets did give him looks in the corners already, specifically more right than left. The power could certainly play there if it continues to develop as hoped. Lantigua’s move stateside will be closely followed at Single-A St. Lucie and beyond.

Martinez was ranked on MLB Pipeline’s Top 50 International Prospects list entering the period and then enjoyed a solid debut, collecting 13 extra-base hits during a stint in the Dominican Summer League played mostly as a 16-year-old. Strong and athletic with a knack for hitting the ball hard, Martinez stands out particularly because of his raw power. He’s shown he is capable of producing uncommonly high exit velocities for a hitter his age, registering readings as hard as 108 mph off the bat during his pro debut. Those numbers are comparable to the type of pop Orioles top prospect Samuel Basallo exhibited as a young prospect, when he was a little-known teenager turning heads by lighting up the exit velo radars at the O’s training facilities. Martinez generates similar numbers and can already drive the ball to all fields, showing better feel for hitting to the opposite field than Basallo did at that age. It’s clear that Martinez’s 6-foot-4, almost 200-pound frame will be able to add more strength as he matures, but he’s also aggressive at the plate and will need to cut down on the swing-and-miss as he advances to develop into an average hitter. Martinez played mostly center field in his debut and has an easily-plus arm. But he’s only an average runner, and though it's possible he could stick in center, the size and power potential make his ceiling look more like that of a run-producing corner outfielder given the chance he grows out of the position.

Miranda had an odd first season in the Dominican Summer League in which more than half of his plate appearances ended in a walk or a strikeout, leading to a .177/.407/.306 line and 105 wRC+ in 22 games. He returned to the DSL as a 19-year-old this year after a delayed start and has looked much more like the player Detroit initially brought in. The power is easily the trademark skill for the 6-foot-3 right-handed slugger. Miranda is a physical presence in the box, capable of rocketing the ball all over the diamond (though he’s pulling the ball even more in game action in 2025). The loudness of contact leads to oodles of extra-base hits already, and given his age, it’s at least plus-plus raw pop right now. Even with the improvements, he’s still struck out about a quarter of the time this summer, though the Tigers believe in the overall trend line. Miranda owns above-average arm strength, which is helpful for third base, but he hasn’t played the field at all in 2025 due to a barking shoulder. Given his lack of range, he’s long been projected to move over to first long-term, and the pressure to hit there will be even more immense. Detroit plans to bring Miranda stateside in the offseason, get him fully healthy and guide him toward another breakout as he enters his 20s.

That’s kind of how the Braves are feeling with Perdomo, considered one of the best prospects in the 2024 international class who received the largest bonus anyone in the class received, $5 million, to sign. But he suffered a hamstring injury that shut him down after just eight games, leaving the Braves a little unsure what kind of player they actually have on their hands. The good news is that Perdomo should have a clean bill of health and be able to truly get going in 2025. Thought to be one of the best pure hitters in his signing class, the right-handed hitter does not swing-and-miss much and can make consistently hard contact. With his knack for finding the barrel comes an over-aggressive approach at times, chasing out of the zone, but he seems to have good pitch recognition skills and the ability to handle all kinds of stuff. He can drive the ball to all fields and there could be plenty of power to come as he matures. Perdomo was at least an above-average runner before the injury and the hope is that will still be an asset on the basepaths post-injury.

That’s kind of how the Braves are feeling with Perdomo, considered one of the best prospects in the 2024 international class who received the largest bonus anyone in the class received, $5 million, to sign. But he suffered a hamstring injury that shut him down after just eight games, leaving the Braves a little unsure what kind of player they actually have on their hands. The good news is that Perdomo should have a clean bill of health and be able to truly get going in 2025. Thought to be one of the best pure hitters in his signing class, the right-handed hitter does not swing-and-miss much and can make consistently hard contact. With his knack for finding the barrel comes an over-aggressive approach at times, chasing out of the zone, but he seems to have good pitch recognition skills and the ability to handle all kinds of stuff. He can drive the ball to all fields and there could be plenty of power to come as he matures. Perdomo was at least an above-average runner before the injury and the hope is that will still be an asset on the basepaths post-injury. He also has a good foundation to play shortstop long-term thanks to good range and arm strength. He’s just 18 for the 2025 season, so there’s still plenty of time for him to reach his ceiling, with the Braves eager to see him get through a full, healthy year.
