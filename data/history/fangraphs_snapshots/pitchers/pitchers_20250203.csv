The right-hander opened 2025 with Double-A San Antonio, moved up to Triple-A El Paso in June and got his first long-awaited taste of the Majors one month later just after he turned 26 years old before being included in the prospect package the A’s received from the Padres in return for Mason Miller and JP Sears at the Trade Deadline. Pitching exclusively out of the stretch, Núñez has the goal to blow both of his pitches past batters, starting with a 97-99 mph heater that has touched as high as 101.4 mph in front of Statcast this season. It’s pure velo over movement here, and Núñez gets minimal extension under six feet (allowing batters to see the fastball a little longer), but it’s still enough to make for an uncomfortable at-bat. The Dominican Republic native’s upper-80s slider is an even better pitch, getting good depth while still being thrown hard, and it’s posted whiff and chase rates above 40 percent in the Minors during Núñez’s time in the San Diego system. Plenty of left-handed hitters have been fooled by the breaking ball too, but without a quality changeup, Núñez has drastic handedness splits. Núñez’s desire to show explosive stuff can lead to inconsistencies in his delivery, and while his control numbers were much-improved with the Padres, he’s still likely to have issues locating routinely in the Majors. But there’s no doubt his electric arsenal is a quality find for a big league bullpen.

He put up a 4.89 ERA (3.83 xERA) with a 27.0/9.2 K%/BB% in 38.2 IP. The 92.2 MPH fastball got hit hard, but it was able to miss bats with a 22% whiff%. The changeup was straight elite with a .207 xwOBA and 43.7% whiff%. The lesser used curve and slider also performed real well with above average xwOBA’s and bat missing ability. It led to a 31.1% whiff% overall, which is elite for a starter. The fastball is below average and the control is below average, which is why I’ve been hesitant to buy in, but proving he can miss that many bats on the MLB level is exciting. He doesn’t seem to have a rotation spot at the moment, but he can certainly win one, and I’m sure he’ll get plenty of innings regardless. I didn’t think I was going to like Cantillo a ton coming into this blurb, but I’m digging him. – 2025 Projection: 6/4.18/1.33/103 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.78/1.29/164 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.766839378238342,0.7461139896373057,0.37823834196891193,0.6321243523316062,65.23,,30.76923076923077,,75.93688362919131,2,0.5,48.54947403024325,59.39181591058514,0.875,MLB,-2.3999999999999986,78.79999999999998,51.875,65.51404477317554,28.125,0.5749999999999998,Mixed,51.397570147928995,23335,playerId

He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2022, and when he returned in 2023, his stuff looked electric in 52.2 IP. He again looked electric in the first half of 2024 with a 2.84 ERA and 25.8/4.0 K%/BB% in 73 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. But the elbow problems returned after his July 6th start, hitting the IL until August 30th. His stuff was way down in that one outing and then he hit the IL again with “a recurrent right forearm injury.” As much as I love the mid to upper 90’s fastball, the plus to double plus slider, plus control, size (6’5”), and pitch mix (he also throws a good changeup and curve), I can’t ignore the very major injury risk. It could end up landing him in the bullpen eventually, or very early into 2025 if he has problems ramping up. If I were to ignore the injury risk, I can see ranking him much higher than this, so this placement factors in a healthy dose of risk. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.10/1.28/45 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/3.72/1.17/130 in 130 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7772020725388601,0.46632124352331605,0.6787564766839378,0.5699481865284974,63.44,,,,78.10650887573965,1,0.25,60.53254437869822,62.42239053254437,1.0,MLB,-2.1972223,76.3666676,40.0,65.07371729976332,30.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,48.056506304893496,23793,playerId

Ever since, it’s been steady progress for the now-23-year-old who spent most of the 2024 season at Double-A before making one Triple-A start. Avila posted a 1.37 WHIP over 19 starts for Northwest Arkansas. It was the first time since 2022 that he didn’t throw over 100 innings, as he missed about six weeks with a minor oblique injury. In five games (three starts) in the Arizona Fall League, Avila posted a 3.07 ERA with 17 strikeouts and eight walks in 14 2/3 innings. The Royals added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft in November. Last year marked the first time Avila missed significant time; he’s been a durable young pitcher for the Royals, and those innings don’t go unnoticed. Avila's comfort zone with his fastball is 94-95 mph with flashes of the upper 90s, and the pitch has natural cut and ride. To help him command the armside of the plate, Avila introduced a two-seamer that is about the same velo as his four-seamer. His 80-82 mph curveball has become a true weapon with high spin and impressive depth; he's gone to it more in 2025 than his four-seamer. A fringe-average changeup rounds out Avila’s arsenal, a pitch he’s still developing with a focus on backing off the 89-91 mph velocity. Avila has near-average command but hides the ball well in his delivery, and as he’s grown, his presence on the mound has gotten stronger. Now that he’s on the 40-man, Avila could make his big league debut at some point in 2025. He needs more development time in Omaha, particularly with his changeup and command, but will be part of the Triple-A depth after dealing with a right shoulder impingement earlier in the summer. Avila will continue to start but might be someone whom the Royals can rely on in different roles depending on need for a long reliever or a swingman.

He put up a 4.06 ERA with a 26.6/8.9 K%/BB% in 37.2 IP at Triple-A. All 4 of his pitches were absolute whiff machines with the 94.4 MPH fastball putting up a decent 21.9% whiff%, the changeup putting up a 49% whiff%, the slider notching a 37.9% whiff%, and the curve putting up a 35.3% whiff%. That is damn impressive. He’s also generally had solid control throughout his career. It’s probably #4 starter upside, but there are jobs to be won in Pitt’s rotation, and I like his profile. He’s a deep league target. – 2025 Projection: 4.35/1.35/83 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.02/1.29/140 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5077720207253886,0.7616580310880829,0.5854922279792747,0.7875647668393783,64.22,,,,46.35108481262328,1,0.25,35.92209072978304,54.31573175542407,0.9275,MLB,-2.2888889,77.4666668,38.1875,63.23571954662722,31.8125,0.5770999999999998,Mixed,46.81503215598225,24728,playerId

He’s expected to be out until mid-season 2025, and it sure seems like he has a lot to come back from. I get writing him off until he proves he is healthy, as he was never a hyped pitching prospect either. But it’s hard to write him off when you remember how good he was in his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 2.70 ERA with a 31.7/9.8 K%/BB% in 20 IP. His 35.0% whiff%, even in a small sample, is very impressive. His slider and changeup were untouchable and the 93.6 MPH 4-seamer and 92.4 MPH sinker performed well too. If he does get healthy, and if he can pick up from 2023, he definitely has impact fantasy starter upside. At this point in the rankings, I think it’s worth hanging onto him. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.33/38 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.24/152 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8963730569948186,0.5284974093264249,0.8911917098445596,0.7927461139896373,77.58,,,,61.34122287968442,1,0.25,47.53944773175542,67.0658067061144,0.9800000000000001,MLB,-0.3833334000000015,54.60000080000002,39.5,70.97874213183432,30.5,0.6385999999999998,Mixed,46.18543411932545,26048,playerId

The Rangers loved the athleticism and upside he showed in sporadic mound appearances as a senior to pay him an over-slot $300,000 bonus as an 18th-rounder in 2019. He has struck out one-third of the hitters he faced in pro ball and made his big league debut with a scoreless inning last September after missing the bulk of the 2024 season with a strained rotator cuff. Church can make hitters look silly with three different pitches, the most devasting of which is a mid-80s slider with two-plane depth at its best. It pairs extremely well with a fastball that sits at 95-97 mph and maxes out at 99 with tremendous carry, though it can straighten out at times. In the Arizona Fall League last offseason, he unveiled a nasty 89-93 mph splitter that dove at the plate. Church is athletic and explodes down the mound to create good extension in his delivery, which features some effort. He has closer upside but will have to throw more strikes after his walk rate jumped from 7 percent in Class A to 12 percent in Double-A and Triple-A. Barring a return of shoulder problems, he could play a key role in Texas’ bullpen this season.

The two gentlemen of Verona soon parted ways, with Mattia setting up shop in the Italian professional league and Samuel signing with the Phillies in July 2019 for $100,000. He didn’t make his pro debut until 2021 and missed most of '22 with a shoulder issue. Things started to click a bit in 2023 then really took off last year, when he reached Double-A for the first time, got traded along with George Klassen in the Carlos Estévez deal and made his big league debut with the Angels. In many ways, Aldegheri is the anti-Klassen, the pitchability lefty vs. the flame-thrower. But he does have a legitimate four-pitch mix and a very good idea of what to do with it. His fastball sits around 92-93 mph and can touch 95-96, and it has decent spin and carry up in the zone. All three of his secondary offerings have bat-missing potential, led by an 84 mph slider that was his go-to breaker. His low-80s changeup has improved to the point that it might be better than the breaking stuff, and he throws a 76 mph curve as well. Combined, they elicited a 44 percent miss rate in 2024, according to Synergy. Aldegheri does an excellent job mixing his pitches and keeping hitters guessing and off balance. While his walk rate hasn’t been akin to a “pitchability” guy, he’s around the zone a lot and there’s better command to come for the southpaw. He’ll be just 23 for most of the 2025 season and it’s looking more and more like he’ll fit into a big league rotation soon.

The fastball only sits 92.2 MPH, but it put up a 19.4% whiff% in the majors, which really isn’t all that bad considering he was a 22 year old who jumped straight to the majors from Double-A. That tells me the low 90’s fastball can definitely play, and he combines that with a plus slider that actually ate up MLB hitters, putting up a .091 xwOBA with a 38.5% whiff%. He also mixed in a below average changeup and below average curve. He wasn’t good in the majors with a 4.85 ERA and 14.9/14.9 K%/BB% in 13 IP, but I’m actually impressed with the fastball/slider combo and pitch mix. He was also a K machine in the minors with a 3.59 ERA and 33.5/10.3 K%/BB% in 95.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. His K rate didn’t dip in the upper minors, which is a big step. If he didn’t have below average control, I might be willing to get really excited for him, but with below average control, I’m leaning a #4 as his reasonable upside. Improving his control, or his third pitch, or his velocity could easily take him up a notch. He’s growing on me. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/79 in 85 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.32/151 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,96,0.4507772020725389,0.10880829015544041,0.47150259067357514,0.16580310880829016,31.29,36.8421052631579,,65.625,42.01183431952663,3,0.75,41.63538260406934,34.910883911424264,1.0,MLB,-4.125,99.5,70.0,42.60776517342728,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,50.07349432804229,26443,playerId

His progress was delayed by persistent hamstring troubles in 2023 and a groin injury in 2024, and he has totaled just 312 innings in his first six years as a pro. He made his big league debut on the final day of last season, spinning three shutout frames against the Cardinals. McDonald ran his four-seam fastball up to 98 mph in 2023 but has focused more on his two-seamer since, operating at 91-94 and touching 96 with more sink but inconsistent success. His mid-80s slider moves in the opposite direction with above-average horizontal action and depth, and it can be a plus pitch at its best. His mid-80s changeup is a bit firm but effective with life that mimic his sinker's. McDonald's low three-quarters slot and short arm action produce significant horizontal action on his two-seamer, slider and changeup. It's not a traditional delivery but he has learned to repeat it well and provide consistent strikes. If he can refine his command further and stay healthy, he could become a back-of-the-rotation starter.

After the White Sox acquired him in a three-prospect package for Dylan Cease in March 2024, he ranked third in the Double-A Southern League in opponent average (.228) and WHIP (1.28) and fourth in ERA (3.71) and strikeouts (122 in 126 innings). He posted a 1.50 ERA in six relief appearances with Chicago at the end of the season. After parking in the mid-90s and peaking at 100 mph in the first half of 2023, Iriarte's fastball has settled in at 92-94 mph with a high of 96, and its excessive armside run now stands out more than its velocity. His sharp 82-85 mph slider has good horizontal action in the opposite direction and plays well off his heater. So does his upper-80s changeup with fade, giving him a third solid offering. While Iriarte wasn't as overpowering as the year before he did throw more strikes, though his control and command still need more work. He's athletic and creates plenty of extension with his delivery, adding to his deception. He could be a No. 3 starter if he improves his location, perhaps more if he recaptures some velocity, but he also could wind up as a late-inning reliever.

He put up a 3.71 ERA with a 22.8/10.7 K%/BB% in 126 IP. The stuff backed up a tick or two, and the performance backed up with it. The fastball sits about 94 MPH and it wasn’t able to miss many bats. It put up a 4.8% whiff% in his 6 IP MLB debut. The slider misses bats (47.1% whiff% in that small MLB sample), and he throws a lesser used changeup which can be an average pitch. Chicago’s rotation is horrific, so they have every reason to stick with Iriarte in the rotation, but it’s not a special profile. It’s a back end profile with mid-rotation upside, which can say about tons of pitching prospects. And it might be a bullpen profile on a team who had a real rotation. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.54/1.41/82 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.24/1.33/135 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.06735751295336789,0.17616580310880828,0.05699481865284972,0.04145077720207254,9.1,44.827586206896555,,,34.9112426035503,2,0.5,33.186594572536215,17.530308100387675,1.0,MLB,-4.391666699999998,100.0,55.0,25.264092430116303,25.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,38.61884159355233,26907,playerId

A year after singing Roddery, the Braves added his twin brother, Rolddy, for just $20,000. It took a while for Rolddy to gain any real traction in the system, spending three seasons in Single- or High-A. He had a little more success in 2023 with High-A Rome, then pitched his way from Rome to Double-A Mississippi, having enough success at the upper level for the Braves to add him to the 40-man roster. Munoz is a 6-foot-2 right-handed reliever only with a very impressive two-pitch power repertoire. He throws both a four- and two-seam fastball at the same velocity, averaging 97-98 mph in 2024 and touching triple digits. While it can get hit at times, his two-seamer has good sink and helps get groundball outs. His 88-91 mph slider plays really well, eliciting a miss rate north of 52 percent last year. One thing that had held Munoz back previously was his inability to throw enough strikes and not always commanding the ball well within the zone when he found it. He’s cut his hit rate down the last two seasons and limited his walks more in 2024. If that continues, his stuff could be effective in high-leverage situations in the big leagues soon.

He barely made it back on a minor league mound with 8.1 IP at High-A and rookie ball after getting shutdown with a “dead arm.” It’s just a reminder that coming back from Tommy John surgery is not always smooth, and while it’s not a death knell by any means, it’s not always a cake walk right back into prime form. Here is how I finished his blurb in last year’s Top 1,000, and honestly, it’s still exactly how I feel now: “When healthy, the 6’4”, 240 pound Cavalli does have plenty to be excited about with big time stuff (95+ MPH fastball) and three quality secondaries in his curve, changeup and slider. The control is inconsistent and his minor league career was a bit up and down, so combined with the Tommy John risk, he’s not someone I’m really targeting.” The one thing he does have going for him is that there is plenty of opportunity in Washington’s rotation, so the leash should be very long for him to shake the rust off. – 2025 Projection: 4/4.38/1.37/94 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.03/1.32/162 in 159 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6683937823834196,0.41968911917098445,0.572538860103627,0.47150259067357514,54.52,,,,66.46942800788955,1,0.25,51.513806706114394,53.46783234714004,1.0,MLB,-1.0555556000000017,62.66666720000002,40.0,55.42634978414202,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,40.97519084286392,27473,playerId

He went undrafted as a Georgia high schooler and while sophomore-eligible last July because of concerns about his bat, athleticism and signability. After slugging 64 homers and winning two Men's College World Series titles in three years at Louisiana State, he somewhat surprisingly lasted until the ninth round and signed with the Pirates for just over $200,000. The 6-foot-4, 246-pound Jones has plenty of strength and leverage in his right-handed stroke, generating top-of-the-scale raw power and exit velocities. He did a better job in 2025 of understanding that he can hit the ball out of any park from foul pole to foul pole without selling out for home runs. Strikeouts will always be part of his game, but he was employing the opposite field more often and doing more damage against breaking balls. Jones lost a little weight and was moving a little better as a junior, but he still has well-below-average speed and athleticism that hinder his value outside of the batter's box. While he does feature impressive arm strength, he's a limited defender who lacks range at first base and may wind up as a DH in pro ball. He caught in high school and briefly as a freshman, and he saw sporadic action at third base as a junior, but neither position is a viable option.

He missed a month early in his Draft year in 2023 with illness and a slight forearm strain but returned to finish strong before the Yankees selected him in the sixth round. He compiled a 3.65 ERA, .187 average-against and 31 percent strikeout rate in his pro debut last summer, mostly at Single-A, before getting shut down for the final three weeks with mild shoulder soreness. Smith's best attribute is his ability to spin the ball, which produces a plus mid-80s slider with two-plane depth and a solid low-80s curveball with similar depth. He also generates high spin rates on his fastball, which operates at 92-94 mph and touches 96 with carry but is also fairly straight and can get pounded when he doesn't command it. He doesn't have much trust in his mid-80s changeup with mild fade and doesn't throw it for strikes. While Smith is a bit smaller than a typical starter, he has a quick arm and a relatively clean delivery. He relies on chases more than landing his pitches in the zone, so he'll need to learn to command his fastball and control his breaking balls as he rises through the Minors. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and a sturdy floor as a multi-inning reliever.

He put up a 2.35 ERA with a 28.1/7.1 K%/BB% in 145.1 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A (he dominated both levels equally). The fastball only sits 90.7 MPH, but it put up a 32.4% whiff% at Triple-A, and the changeup is at least plus with a 45% whiff%. The cutter and slider are useful pitches too which can induce weak contact. The control is solid, but it’s been below average at points in his career, and you probably really have to count on plus control to maximize this profile. – 2025 Projection: Prime Projection: 10/4.19/130/149 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.694300518134715,0.6994818652849741,0.8860103626943006,0.8601036269430051,76.6,,,,4.536489151873768,1,0.25,3.51577909270217,51.02052268244576,1.0,MLB,-1.3861111999999984,66.63333439999998,40.0,67.43115696473373,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,47.17068751413017,27932,playerId

He was added to the 40-man roster that offseason and then traded to the D-backs for outfielder Dominic Fletcher. Playing in his first season in the Arizona system, Mena finished with a 4.61 ERA, 102 strikeouts and 46 walks in 95 2/3 innings for Triple-A Reno and got a cup of coffee and the start for his Major League debut on July 3. He didn’t pitch again after July 25 due to a right forearm strain but is considered good to go for 2025. The youngest pitcher to throw more than 90 frames at Triple-A last season, Mena should be graded on somewhat of a curve, and he showed up to camp with good added weight and strength. That’s promising because he already added velocity in 2024 and was showing a four-seamer and a sinker around 92-94 mph. His velo has been up another tick in 2025. Both pitches were extremely hittable without stellar movement in Triple-A, though, and Mena needed to rely more on his mid-80s breaking pitches to get whiffs. His curveball drops sharply downward while his slider shows decent sweep but can bleed into the curve. Mena lands both well out of a high three-quarters slot, and batters have trouble reading it out of his hand. The curve has become the better of the two and has been used almost like a primary pitch in '25. An 89-91 mph changeup gave him an armside offspeed option but doesn't have much separation at all. Mena doesn’t look like he’s overthrowing out of an athletic delivery, but because he’s so reliant on breaking pitches, he can run into control issues if hitters don’t chase them outside the zone. His age means he should still have a long leash as a starter, and improving fastball quality would be a big help.

He made 21 appearances in the winter league back home ahead of ’24, and that helped set the 6-foot-1 right-hander set off on a massive breakout campaign. Pitching exclusively in relief, Rodriguez posted a 2.64 ERA and .180 average-against with 75 strikeouts in 61 1/3 innings across three levels, topping out at Double-A San Antonio. Pitch for pitch, Rodriguez may have the most dynamic stuff in the entire San Diego system. Pitching in shorter stints, he touched 101 mph in 2024 and sat 96-99 with his fastball, and low-level batters just couldn’t handle that level of heat, particularly when he ran it up the ladder to the top of the zone. His changeup was arguably even better -- an 86-89 mph offering with the right amount of separation and tunneling leading to a 58.2 percent whiff rate in ’24. His hard upper-80s slider was an option saved for righties and flashes above average. It's certainly an effortful delivery from the righty to get to those upper-level velocities, and it didn’t come as a shock that his control wavered as he climbed the ladder in 2024. There is a certain temptation to see how he would look as a starter, considering Rodriguez will still only be 21 for the entire ’25 campaign, but the stuff plays so well in relief now, it might be best to let him be. He’s already a quick climber in the traditional Padres prospect mold and could impact the San Diego bullpen soon.

He put up a 3.80 ERA with a 32.1/10.8 K%/BB% in 104.1 IP in the upper minors. He then got a shot in the majors, and while the 16% K% in 28.1 IP isn’t impressive, his slider (36.5% whiff%) and curve (35.3% whiff%) were both whiff machines, so he clearly has more in the tank. He also throws gas with a 96.1 MPH fastball, although it wasn’t a very good pitch in the majors. He threw the fastball more than 50% of the time, and combined with the below average control and lack of rotation spot, there are enough seasons to doubt him to not get too carried away here. But velocity, swing and miss secondaries, and upper minors production is a strong trifecta, so if he works his way into a rotation spot, I’d be happy to roster him to see how it plays out. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/66 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.31/151 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.015544041450777257,0.3316062176165803,0.0,0.015544041450777202,9.99,,,,68.0473372781065,1,0.25,52.736686390532526,24.951340236686384,1.0,MLB,-3.0694444999999995,86.833334,40.0,26.004902171005913,30.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,32.56887277695266,29271,playerId

He led the Minors with 338 strikeouts between the 2022 and 2023 seasons and spent the entire latter campaign with Triple-A Nashville. After a brief return to the International League in the spring of 2024, the southpaw made five solid starts for the Major League club in which he lasted at least five frames in each appearance. He reported elbow issues after a June 1 outing and after a series of opinions, eventually underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery. Before the procedure, the 6-foot left-hander showed off a pair of 91-94 mph fastballs with a four-seamer and a sinker, the latter of which averaged nearly 16 inches of armside run in the bigs. His 79-82 mph slider was actually his most oft-used single pitch in the Majors, a real sweeping option that almost mirrors the horizontal movement of the sinker and befuddled both righties and lefties alike. A changeup and cutter -- both in the upper-80s -- round out the arsenal as options against righties, with the latter acting more like a bullet for anyone sitting on the spin of the slider. Gasser walked only one of the 114 Major League batters he faced, but he’s shown closer to average control throughout his pro career. His command will be worth monitoring as he continues to his return to pitching in the second half of 2025. It still might not be until 2026 that Gasser factors back into Milwaukee’s rotation.

The 21.6% whiff% was better than the K rate, and his most used pitch, the sweeper, had a strong 34.5% whiff%. He missed plenty of bats in the minors, so the K rate (and walk rate) should have normalized over time, but he didn’t have time. He injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery in June 2024 which will knock him out for most or all of 2025. He doesn’t have the upside I look for when taking the TJ discount, so he’s not a target for me, but he was looking like another underrated Brewers success story before going down with the injury. – 2025 Projection: OUT Prime Projection: 9/4.08/1.30/140 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8341968911917098,0.6113989637305699,0.7409326424870466,0.7564766839378239,73.86,26.923076923076927,,,41.42011834319527,2,0.5,30.07273175542407,58.534456114398424,0.95,MLB,-1.8500000000000014,72.20000000000002,53.75,69.01333683431953,26.25,0.6364999999999998,Mixed,52.30850157544379,29812,playerId

The stuff is quite good with a bat missing 93.7 MPH fastball, 3 plus, bat missing secondaries (slider, changeup, sweeper) and a solid curve too. It resulted in a 3.78 ERA with a 32.9% K%. Pitchers are notorious for having something click later in their career, so even at 26 years old, I don’t think that is too old for a breakout considering the talent is still in here. One other complicating factor is that he went down with a shoulder injury after his July 30th start. He returned for one start at the end of the season where the velocity was down 2 ticks. He was probably just taking it easy, but it does tack on extra risk heading into the off-season. Baltimore has tons of opportunity is their rotation right now, so they have every reason to keep McDermott a starter for as long as possible, and he has the fantasy friendly upside to roster as a proximity arm in medium to deeper leagues. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.35/90 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.31/172 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.10880829015544047,0.31865284974093266,0.06735751295336789,0.05699481865284974,14.93,,,,41.81459566074951,1,0.25,32.40631163708087,21.046709072978302,1.0,MLB,-1.0777777999999998,62.9333336,40.0,23.965512761893493,30.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,26.871147462852072,29866,playerId

After hitting and pitching for a season, Chandler put the bat away for good and has developed into one of the best pitching prospects in baseball, reaching Triple-A in 2024 and serving notice that he's ready to contribute to a big league rotation. Chandler has rapidly evolved from an athlete and thrower to a complete pitcher with a real idea of how to use all four of his pitches effectively. It still starts with his elite-level fastball that averaged 96.7 mph and touched 99 in 2024, according to Synergy. It has impressive vertical break, his command of the pitch has improved and he holds the premium velocity deep into starts. The Pirates challenged Chandler to focus on the development of his secondary offerings, and he responded with a much-improved 86-87 mph slider and upper-80s changeup while still dropping in the occasional low-80s curve. The athletic right-hander showed that he's learned not to lean solely on his heater by throwing slider-changeup-slider to start out the first batter he faced in Triple-A. His strike-throwing continues to improve, and he has the chance to eventually have three plus pitches he can land in the zone. Honing his craft while working out with Paul Skenes, Jared Jones and fellow prospect Thomas Harrington will only help him reach his considerable ceiling.

Chandler most certainly fell into the pure stuff first category with his upside being obvious, but he had a lot of refinement needed with a 4.75 ERA and 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% 106 IP at High-A in 2023. And that refinement smacked upper minors hitters right in the face in 2024 with him exploding. He put up a 3.08 ERA with a 30.9/8.6 K%/BB% in 119.2 IP. He was even better at Triple-A than he was at Double-A. The fastball sits 96.8 MPH and notched a 30.5% whiff% at Triple-A. The changeup is his best secondary with a 83.6 MPH EV against and 41.2% whiff%. The slider is above average with a 85 MPH EV against and 29.4% whiff%. And the lesser used curve was a good pitch too. He also most certainly looks the part at a built up and athletic 6’2”. There is zero doubt that this is an elite pitching prospect with ace upside. He’s not a completely finished product and he needs to continue to improve his command and refine his pitches, but he’s shown he’s more than capable of making those improvements in 2024. He could crack the Pirates rotation out of camp, and even if he doesn’t, it won’t be long before he gets the call. I know everyone likes Jobe more, and I obviously love Jobe too, but I prefer Chandler by a hair – 2025 Projection: 7/3.87/1.25/137 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.34/1.13/220 in 185 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3471502590673575,0.5906735751295337,0.21761658031088082,0.41450777202072536,39.72,96.15384615384616,93.33333333333333,,96.25246548323472,3,0.75,88.21252465483235,56.692383629191326,1.0,MLB,-5.138888900000001,100.0,70.0,53.8537150887574,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,55.23417178994083,29868,playerId

He put up a 4.02 ERA with a 21.6/6.9 K%/BB% in 150 IP at Triple-A. The fastball only sits low 90’s and none of his secondaries miss a ton of bats. It’s a back end profile, but I can’t ignore his MLB debut. He put up a 1.96 ERA with a 20.9/2.3 K%?BB% in 23 IP. His slider put up a very good 34.5% whiff%, the 92.9 MPH fastball put up an elite 30% whiff% the cutter was an excellent pitch with a .208 xwOBA, his sinker put up a negative 8 degree launch, and his much lesser used curve put up a 50% whiff%. Those pitches didn’t perform as well at Triple-A as they did in the majors, so there is definitely some small sample stuff going on, but at the least, the pro debut proved his profile will transfer. He might end up an elite control #3/4, which will definitely play. – 2025 Projection: 9/4.15/1.29/125 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8652849740932642,0.40414507772020725,0.9326424870466321,0.772020725388601,73.66,,,,43.58974358974359,1,0.25,33.78205128205128,59.70271794871795,1.0,MLB,-2.9555556000000003,85.4666672,40.0,71.24381546461538,30.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,52.653050399076925,29869,playerId

He had his 2nd strong MLB outing in a row, going 5 IP with 5 hits, 2 ER, and a 5/2 K/BB vs. Oakland. The fastball sat 95.4 MPH and put up a 29% whiff%, while the slider and curve were solid as well with a 33% and 30% whiff%. It led to a 31% whiff% overall. His first outing against Cleveland was more of the same, and he now has a 2.25 ERA with a 30.4% whiff% in 8 IP. He has size (6’6”, 230 pounds), velocity (mid 90’s heat that misses bats) and bat missing secondaries (slider, curve change). He didn’t perform well at Triple-A with a 4.62 ERA in 64.1 IP, but all 4 of his pitches missed a ton of bats leading to a 31% K%. Control is the biggest problem here with well below average walk rates his entire career, but super tall pitchers can sometimes take longer to make control gains, and we all know that pitching development isn’t linear. So far in the majors he has a 8.3% BB%. Again, I’m not calling him a target, but I am saying there is some very interesting stuff going on here. There are definitely ingredients for a big breakout in the future, and as a free pick up in the vast majority of leagues, I don’t hate it all. Consider this your first little warning on Burke.” … and after that outing, Burke dominated in 2 more starts with 1 ER and a 14/4 K/BB in 11 IP. If he was able to do it in a larger sample, he might have been valued more closely with Spencer Arrighetti (both have similar-ish profiles), and I’m apt to use the small sample to my advantage. The skills are there are to be a high K mid-rotation starter, and he did prove it on the MLB level. He’s an excellent later round target. – 2025 Projection: 8/3.96/1.31/149 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.07772020725388606,0.07253886010362694,0.31088082901554404,0.07772020725388601,12.81,,,,79.09270216962526,1,0.25,61.29684418145957,29.78039546351085,0.605,MLB,-2.3999999999999986,78.79999999999998,30.125,27.79961863905325,39.875,0.5160499999999998,Mixed,28.31357838757396,29878,playerId

He put up a 4.86 ERA with a 28.5/11.0 K%/BB% in 87 IP at Triple-A. He might not have been the wunderkind we hoped for, but he’s still a good pitching prospect with a 95 MPH fastball that gets good movement and misses bats. The secondaries are good too with a changeup that notched a 42.3% whiff% and 84.8 MPH EV, a slider that notched a 34.8% whiff% and 86.1 MPH EV, and a decent curve that notched a 81.6 MPH EV and 23.9% whiff%. That is 3 potentially above average to plus pitches with a decent 4th pitch. Even with below average control, that profile could work as a #3/4 type starter, but what would really pull this entire thing together is a big step forward in control/command. Atlanta is also a great organization to bet on for pitching prospects.

He put up a 2.58 ERA with a 21.7/3.4 K%/BB% in 45.1 IP. The control is elite, he has a bat missing secondary in his sweeper (37% whiff%), and all 4 of his pitches put up impressive xwOBA’s (from .148 to .263). He very well might be one of Detroit’s 5 best starters, and if that’s true, I’m sure he’ll make his way into the rotation eventually. But without a current spot, it’s hard to go higher than this. – 2025 Projection: 6/3.98/1.26/86 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.82/1.23/133 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6269430051813472,0.025906735751295335,0.9119170984455959,0.15544041450777202,44.47,,,,36.489151873767256,1,0.25,28.27909270216962,38.80318244575937,0.38,MLB,-1.1166666999999997,63.400000399999996,24.5,45.60945479372781,45.5,0.5551999999999999,Mixed,31.279254737177514,30133,playerId

The former supplemental first-round Draft pick spent April repeating Double-A Erie with instructions to hone his newly-developed splitter. After four SeaWolves starts, Madden moved to Triple-A Toledo, where he posted a 7.97 ERA and allowed 17 homers in 79 innings but also fanned 102 batters, 11 of them over a 5 2/3-inning loss in which he gave up 12 hits. The Tigers, needing pitching, believed in the stuff over results and called him up at the end of August. Though he mainly worked out of the bullpen, his seven strikeouts over five innings of one-run ball earned him his first Major League win Sept. 8 at Oakland. He also made Detroit’s postseason bullpen. Madden’s mid-90s fastball and snappy slider form a dynamic duo that has been his weapon against hitters ever since his days as a starter at the University of Texas. His heater plays up beyond its 94 mph average with good ride, allowing it to play at the top of the strike zone and set up the slider to change eye levels. An upper-80s cutter was an effective pitch at Triple-A with mixed results in limited Major League use. Though Madden’s new splitter improved as a swing-and-miss pitch on his way up the Minors, he’s still learning when to use it and how to set it up. Madden missed more bats later in the season after lowering his arm angle a tad and changing his positioning on the mound at Toledo. The Tigers have left the door open for Madden to compete for a starting job, but Detroit’s wealth of pitching could ultimately leave the bullpen as his best route to stick in the big leagues. His ability to take constructive criticism and adapt his game impressed coaches and higher-ups last year. A right rotator cuff strain kept him from being part of the equation through the first half of 2025.

The right-hander was limited by forearm, triceps and shoulder injuries, and facing his age-25 season in 2025, he moved to the bullpen with Double-A Erie. He’s flourished in that role and debuted with the Tigers’ Major League relief corps on June 2. As expected, Smith’s fastball velocity has taken a nice jump in shorter stints, moving from 92-94 as a starter in 2024 to 93-96, touching 98, as a reliever. On top of the velo, the four-seamer comes with cut-ride action to give it a boost, and Smith will mix in a sinker to present batters with another look with more armside run. The former Crimson Tide hurler’s mid-80s sweeper has become his go-to breaking ball (over his curveball) and best pitch at generating whiffs-per-swing with 9-12 inches of horizontal break. Smith also has a splitter around the same velo to kill spin and give him another option for lefties, though it lags behind the other pitches in usage. Smith’s control hasn’t suffered even as his stuff has ticked up, and he isn’t overthrowing from his high three-quarters slot to get that extra juice. The injuries were what moved him to the bullpen in the first place, and it seems like one-to-two-inning stints are the best way to keep him on the mound and harness the best version of his arsenal. He could become a key piece of A.J. Hinch’s relief plans as the Tigers head back toward the postseason.

He made his MLB debut and got absolutely shellacked, putting up a 8.83 ERA with a 17.9/9.8 K%/BB% in 35.2 IP. He also didn’t have the minor league career you would have expected from a talent like this, although he was much better in 2024 than 2023 with a 3.51 ERA and 33.3/10.6 K%/BB% in 77 IP at Triple-A. The below average control is killing him, but there is more than enough here for me to stick to my guns about staying strong. His 96.4 MPH fastball is a bat missing weapon that put up a 32.1% whiff% at AAA and a 28.9% whiff% in the majors. His slider was a whiff machine at AAA with a 43.2% whiff%, but it dropped off in the majors with a 21.8% whiff%. But on the flip side, his lesser used curve and changeup were actually pretty good in the majors. The curve put up a .212 xwOBA with a 38.7% whiff% on 11.4% usage, and the change put up a .237 xwOBA with a 35.7% whiff% on 5.8% usage. The pieces are still here to turn into an impact fantasy starter, and it seemingly should be able to work even with below average control, but so far, it just hasn’t come together. We’ve seen this story a million times from top level talents like Leiter, so while he could easily end up being a bust, I’m not writing him off to that fate yet. He’s a hold for me. – 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.34/127 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.74/1.26/183 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.30051813471502586,0.40932642487046633,0.41709844559585496,0.37305699481865284,36.87,,,,78.89546351084813,1,0.25,61.14398422090729,45.36589447731755,0.6275000000000001,MLB,-2.7416666999999997,82.9000004,30.6875,46.323268403195264,39.3125,0.5162749999999998,Mixed,37.66609586143787,30146,playerId

He was mostly a control over stuff guy coming into this year, but it sure looks like he’s changing that profile into a stuff over control guy now, and for fantasy, that is definitely what we want to see, but he still has to prove he can truly harness the stuff in a starting role. He’s so obviously a major riser this spring, and with Bello starting the year on the IL, there is a rotation spot to be won, so he makes for a great underrated target. I’m just worried with how much hype he’s getting, he’s not actually going to be all that underrated.” 2025 Projection: 6/4.33/1.36/108 in 110 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5699481865284974,0.21243523316062177,0.6010362694300518,0.29533678756476683,43.18,,,,47.53451676528599,1,0.25,36.839250493096635,40.96073767258382,1.0,MLB,-2.3972222999999993,78.76666759999999,40.0,47.85222144177514,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,40.786833168798815,30160,playerId

The Twins took that arm strength at No. 26 overall, but he wasn’t there for long. He was just getting going in his first Spring Training when he went to the Reds in the Sonny Gray deal. He’s earned a promotion in each of his three seasons of pro ball, even with a careful workload in 2023 following a minor elbow issue, and the gloves came off in 2024 as he topped 130 innings and finished with a pair of strong starts in Triple-A. Petty’s evolution and maturation from thrower to complete pitcher has continued, though he’s still throwing plenty hard enough. His fastball is almost a setup pitch to his secondary offerings, but he still averaged 95-96 mph, touching the upper 90s, and his two-seamer features good sink for groundball contact. At times he has a distinct upper-80s slider and a 91-92 mph cutter, although they occasionally run into each other. They miss bats at a high rate in any iteration. He has a firm upper-80s changeup that isn’t quite as effective, but it can kill spin and offer some sink and fade. With an athletic delivery, Petty has a strong track record of filling up the strike zone, though his walk rate did balloon in Double-A in 2024. He’s still very young for his stage of development, pitching all of 2025 at age 22, and he came to Spring Training even more physical.

He worked on regaining that velocity this off-season, and it worked with him back up into the mid 90’s all season. It came at the cost of his control, and he didn’t have a particularly great year, but we are watching the development of a very talented, first round high school arm right before our eyes on the professional level. He was a freshly turned 21 in the upper minors all season and put up a 4.20 ERA with a 22.4/10.2 K%/BB% in 137 IP. He racked up innings, he maintained his stuff, and he more than held his own against much older competition. He has an excellent bat missing secondary in his slider, he has a solid change to use against lefties, and the big velocity is back. I’m sure he’s going to go back in the lab this off-season to continue to improve and work on his game. He’s not a truly coveted pitching prospect, but he’s a still a good one. – 2025 Projection: 1/4.44/1.38/38 in 45 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/174 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.20725388601036265,0.08290155440414508,0.3523316062176166,0.09844559585492228,18.68,76.0,0.0,,46.94280078895463,3,0.75,38.556155006381246,25.636654252233434,1.0,MLB,-5.6944444999999995,100.0,70.0,32.96499627567003,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,45.834248324051515,30170,playerId

He reached San Francisco for 10 appearances in 2024-25, blanking the Royals for 5 2/3 innings in September 2024 for his lone victory. Kansas City acquired him in exchange for righty pitching prospect Logan Martin after the Giants designated Black for assignment in November this year. Black throws two variations of an average fastball and the velocity on his heater dipped in 2024 and hasn't bounced back. Both his two- and four-seamers sit around 93 mph and top out at 96. Neither his low-80s sweeping slider nor his mid-80s cutter have been as effective in 2025 as they were last season, leaving him without a better than average offering. Though Black also possesses a fading upper-80s changeup, it's too firm and flat and he didn't elicit a single swing and miss with the 91 cambios he threw last season. He slings his pitches from a low three-quarters delivery with quality extension that gives him deception without costing him the ability to throw strikes. He's more of a back-of-the-rotation starter unless he regains some velocity and improves his command.

The 4.52 xERA and 26.4/9.1 K%/BB% look much better, and his pitches were missing bats. His 93.8 MPH 4-seamer actually performed excellently with a 24.6% whiff% and .255 xwOBA. His famed sweeper wasn’t great, but it still put up a 37.1% whiff%, which tells me better day are ahead, and the underlying numbers on the changeup were really good with a .221 xwOBA and 32% whiff%. Both the changeup and sweeper got massively unlucky, which was the main culprit for the ridiculous ERA. He also throws a sinker and cutter, giving him a diverse pitch mix. He wasn’t good at Triple-A either with a 5.91 ERA in 109.2 IP, but again, the 28.0/8.0 K%/BB% looked much better. He’s probably a back end starter, but I don’t think his 2024 was as bad as it seemed on the surface. Looking at the underlying metrics of the individual pitches actually paints a kinda encouraging picture. He’s only a deeper league play right now, but I would hold him in those leagues. 2025 Projection: 7/4.31/1.35/124 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.32/153 in 150 IP Update: Injuries could push him into a starting role and he’s looked good this spring",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.772020725388601,0.5181347150259067,0.7512953367875648,0.6606217616580311,67.83,,,,36.29191321499013,1,0.25,28.126232741617347,53.933681459566074,0.575,MLB,-1.8944444999999988,72.73333399999999,29.375,64.39660453786982,40.625,0.5629999999999998,Mixed,43.306388842041414,30182,playerId

It’s the plus control and plus changeup that has been befuddling upper minors hitters, and we know that profile can often stall in the majors. Regardless, he’s knocking on the door of the bigs, and the upper minors production is certainly there with a 3.08 ERA and 27.8/6.7 K%BB% in 128.2 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A. He also throws a solid curve and cutter, giving him a starter’s pitch mix.

But there are a few other truly elite pitching prospects in the minors right now (Painter, Schultz, Bubba, Kumar), and Jobe’s 25.6/12.0 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP at mostly Double-A just isn’t as impressive as theirs. It came with a 2.34 ERA, and the stuff is filthy with a 97 MPH plus fastball and 3 potentially plus secondaries in his sweeper, changeup, and cutter, so he’s right there with all of them, he just doesn’t hold down the top spot right now. Or the top 2. I have him 4th behind Painter, Schultz and Bubba, but there is no shame in that game as those guys are potentially true aces, just like Jobe is.

You have no idea when or if they will get a shot, and they will get almost no leash when they do get a shot. It’s just too big of a pain in the ass for fantasy, and while I like Wrobleski, his upside isn’t quite high enough to wait around and hope he ends up in the rotation. He has a plus mid 90’s fastball that misses bats and induces weak contact, both in the upper minors and in the majors. He pairs that with a potentially above average slider as his best out pitch, and he has a diverse pitch mix (he also throws a cutter, curve, sinker, and changeup). It all resulted in a 3.76 ERA with a 25.9/7.7 K%/BB% in 95.2 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. He got knocked around in the majors with a 5.70 ERA and 16.9/10.4 K%/BB% in 36.1 IP, but he has still able to show the skills could potentially translate if given the leash. He has no leash though, and he has no rotation spot. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.33/55 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/155 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.21761658031088082,0.20725388601036268,0.5803108808290156,0.27979274611398963,30.57,,,,65.08875739644971,1,0.25,50.44378698224852,37.525825443786985,1.0,MLB,-2.9722222999999985,85.66666759999998,40.0,40.921247773136095,30.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,39.047895017911245,31204,playerId

He went to the Brewers in the fourth round that summer, and his career has been marked by injuries since -- first elbow surgery in 2022 and then an oblique issue that delayed his opening to the 2024 season. He eventually posted a career-high 81 1/3 innings (primarily at Double-A Biloxi and Triple-A Nashville) and finished with a 3.32 ERA, 104 strikeouts and 15 walks in that span. The 5-foot-11 right-hander has developed two plus pitches in his 91-94 mph fastball and 80-82 mph changeup. Henderson’s heater averaged over 17 inches of induced vertical break at Triple-A, placing it above many bats at the top of the zone, and that movement profile helped it play above the velo. The changeup is his best pitch with sufficient fade and separation to generate plenty of whiffs on its own. Henderson’s heat map is, as expected, more vertically focused as a result. He eschewed a low-80s slider for more of an 87-89 mph cutter during his time with Nashville for a sharper, gloveside look, but even so, seven-eighths of his pitch usage comes from the fastball or change. Henderson repeats his delivery well, rarely pitching out of a full windup, and he’s become a regular strike pumper at the upper levels. That said, he can get hit around if the fastball seeps below the top of the zone or if he doesn’t bury the changeup. Added to the 40-man roster last November, the 23-year-old has dominated in his early tastes of the Major Leagues, firmly answering questions about whether his two best pitches could work as a starter in The Show.

He was lights out at Double-A with a 3.30 ERA and 32.6/3.9 K%/BB% in 46.1 IP. The fastball only sits 92.5 MPH but it gets good movement and is a bat missing weapon. The nasty changeup is his best secondary and a heavily used pitch that both misses bats and induces weak contact. He rounds out the arsenal with a mediocre cutter. Plus control with an excellent secondary and a bat missing, low 90’s fastball can definitely work, but lack of a good breaking ball is a problem. Maybe he’s just a back end starter, but I think there is some mid rotation upside in here, and if he can develop a legitimate breaking ball (he’s still only 22 as of this writing), I don’t think it’s out of the question for him to end up a legit impact fantasy starter. You also have to trust Milwaukee with a guy like this. Henderson is definitely a nice proximity arm to target even in shallower leagues. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.30/63 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.85/1.23/155 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6994818652849741,0.6269430051813472,0.6632124352331606,0.7098445595854922,67.3,76.92307692307692,8.333333333333337,,66.27218934911244,3,0.75,48.43666608655296,60.69783313029353,1.0,MLB,-4.605555599999999,100.0,70.0,70.22434993908806,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,62.60095747258963,31475,playerId

With the right players, they are proving the strategy can definitely work. Dana spent the entire season at Double-A as a 20 year old and excelled with a 2.52 ERA and 27.4/7.3 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP. He then got a taste of the majors and struggled with a 9.58 ERA and 15.4/13.5 K%/BB% in 10.1 IP, but that is basically meaningless. He racked up an impressive amount of innings for a 20 year old, and that was at the end of a very long season. He most certainly looks the part at a rock solid 6’4”, 210 pounds. The fastball sat 93.7 MPH and it gets good movement with bat missing ability. There could also be another tick or 2 coming down the line. The slider is nasty and even in his rough MLB debut it performed well with a 37.5% whiff%. The lesser used changeup, curve and cutter all performed really well too with a 37.5%, 50%, and 66.7% whiff%, respectively. He has about average command of the entire arsenal. He showed off mid rotation upside in 2024, and that was as a 20 year old in the upper minors and the majors. If he can take a step forward this off-season with his arsenal and command, there could be yet another level in here. – 2025 Projection: 4/4.27/1.34/87 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.73/1.20/194 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.04663212435233166,0.26424870466321243,0.17098445595854928,0.17616580310880828,15.63,,81.81818181818181,90.0,78.69822485207101,3,0.75,75.84867312175002,36.70653559261251,1.0,MLB,-6.397222299999999,100.0,70.0,34.608460677783754,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,46.57380730500269,31508,playerId

It was true during his three years at Georgia Tech where he struck out 14.7 per nine and walked a batter per inning. And it’s been true since the Reds took him in the sixth round of the 2022 Draft. He’s missed bats at every stop, with a 14.0 K/9 rate while reaching Triple-A in 2024, and while the walk rate is a little better than his Yellow Jackets days, he still carries a career 6.2 BB/9 rate into the 2025 season. Maxwell is a mountain of a man at 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, and he does not mess around on the mound. He comes at hitters with two power pitches. He throws his fastball almost 70 percent of the time and why not? It averaged over 99 mph last year and touched 103 mph, according to Synergy. When it’s right, it has good carry up in the zone and misses a lot of bats. So does his power 88-90 mph slider with cutter-like action, but he only lands it in the zone about half the time. There was some progress during Maxwell’s first year of pro ball as he shaved quite a bit off his walk rate, but it crept back up in 2024 even as the Reds were pleased with how he handled high-leverage situations they put him in. He’s knocking on the door to help the big league bullpen out, and what kind of role he might have will be completely dependent on any ability to find the strike zone more consistently.

He’s done nothing but start since then, making it up to Triple-A, the first place he had any kind of prolonged struggles, as he lost his feel a bit over his nine starts with Albuquerque. There’s confidence that Palmquist will make the necessary adjustments to find success both there and in the big leagues because he’s shown the ability to do so at every level since he’s entered pro ball. With a funky delivery that adds plenty of deception, and a lower arm slot, all of the left-hander’s pitches play up despite them grading out as largely average across the board. His fastball averages only around 91 mph, but it misses more bats than it should thanks to carry up in the zone from that lower slot. He’ll actually throw two different kinds of sliders -- a big sweepy one in the upper 70s and a slightly harder, cutter-ish one, both of which can miss bats. His low-80s changeup is also effective and hard to square up. Other than his time in Triple-A, Palmquist has largely been around the zone as he’s moved up the ladder and he loves going right after hitters and pitching inside without fear. He’s added a little strength and answered some durability questions with his 2024 campaign, so there’s hope he can start long-term, even if he is first called upon to help out of the bullpen should the need arise in Denver.

He put up a 14.4% BB% in 97.1 IP at mostly Double-A. They moved him into the bullpen when he got the call to Triple-A, and the control didn’t improve in short outings either with a 14.3% BB%. He finished the season with a 3.33 ERA and 30.5/14.4 K%/BB%. His evaluation basically remains exactly the same from last off-season. He’s 6’7”, 190 pounds with premium stuff and super high upside. The upper 90’s fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon and his breaking balls are plus and miss bats. You hate to say it, but it is really a reliever profile right now. It’s far too early into his development process to write him off as a starter though, and I highly doubt Milwaukee is ready to do that either. Even if he breaks into the majors in the bullpen, he will definitely be a candidate to get transitioned back into the rotation at some point too. I’ll keep betting on the huge stuff and let the chips fall where they may. – 2025 Projection: 3/3.91/1.34/67 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.58/1.27/183 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7202072538860104,0.8031088082901554,0.2227979274611399,0.6424870466321243,61.98,,,,86.3905325443787,1,0.25,66.95266272189349,63.72043195266272,1.0,MLB,-4.691666699999999,100.0,40.0,68.20512958579882,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,54.192308313609466,31623,playerId

After he showcased his usual stuff in the Cape Cod League that summer, the Giants took him in the second round and paid him a well-over-slot $1,866,200. He dominated in his first full pro season and advanced to Double-A before getting shut down with an elbow sprain in late July, then posted a 5.42 ERA in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League during a mostly healthy 2024. Whisenhunt may feature the best changeup in baseball, posting outlandish chase (49 percent) and swing-and-miss (47 percent) rates while recording 71 of his 135 strikeouts (second in the PCL) with his cambio in Triple-A. He sells his tumbling 78-81 mph change with fastball arm speed and can manipulate its depth and shape. He sets it up with a 92-94 mph two-seamer that reaches 96 with some sink, but it didn't have enough life to avoid getting hammered last year when he didn't command it well. Whisenhunt never has demonstrated great feel for spin, and while his low-80s slider is a bit better than his upper-70s curveball, neither is particularly effective. He struggled with a tighter zone and smaller ballparks in the PCL, and his strike-throwing regressed before rebounding in the final two months. He has the athleticism to repeat his delivery well enough to have at least average control. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and his changeup alone should help him carve out a role in San Francisco.

The two main things he has going for him though are that all of his pitches can miss bats (sinker, change, cutter, slider), and he’ll have a great ballpark at his back if he does get a shot in the rotation. Strikeouts and a run suppressing home ballpark could be good enough to make an impact. The changeup is a legit double plus weapon and 93.2 MPH sinker can be asset when it’s at it’s best, but it wasn’t at it’s best in 2024. The slider and cutter also show promise as legit 3rd and 4th pitches, so there is a world where everything comes together and Whisenhunt can thrive in the rotation. But I think the most likely world is that he ends up in the bullpen, or as a back end 4-5 IP type guy. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.44/1.38/55 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.33/135 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2901554404145078,0.16580310880829016,0.7305699481865284,0.35233160621761656,36.38,70.0,,73.17073170731707,46.74556213017751,3,0.75,55.298419685380274,43.0014468898831,1.0,MLB,-3.238888899999999,88.86666679999999,70.0,46.239434086964934,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,49.581078699134224,31676,playerId

He climbed steadily through New York's system until getting rocked in Triple-A in 2024, though he recovered to pitch better there this year and made his big league debut in May. The Giants acquired him as part of a package for Tyler Rogers two months later. Tidwell displayed good four-seam velocity in the 94-96 mph range, topping out at 98, with decent riding action, but lefties in particular feasted on the pitch, slugging .606 against it at Triple-A. The 6-foot-4 right-hander also worked in a 92-94 mph sinker with almost double the armside movement to give another fastball look. He works with a variety of gloveside offerings between an 80-83 mph sweeper, an 82-85 mph traditional slider and a sharper 87-89 mph cutter. The sweeper, averaging around 15 inches of break, was a menace against righties. Tidwell also mixed in an occasional 81-84 mph changeup and upper-70s curveball. The former Volunteer struggled to adapt to the Major League ball and more advanced hitters at the Minors’ top level, and his 13.7 percent walk rate was seventh-highest in Triple-A (min. 80 IP). Some evaluators believe Tidwell may have been getting too fine in his location and that he needs to trust his stuff will play in zone more often. If he still can’t tame the control woes, his stuff would certainly play in a shorter relief setting.

He put up a 5.93 ERA with a 19.8/13.7 K%/BB% in 85 IP. Triple-A was messing around with the automated strikezone and challenge system, so a lot of guys struggled there, but they are also the only level to use the MLB ball, which adds a different dynamic to evaluating pitchers. Quinn Mathews and Brandon Sproat had a similar split between Double-A and Triple-A, but because theirs happened in a small sample at the end of the season, everyone is just ignoring it. Because Tidwell struggled over a longer sample, everyone has completely jumped ship. The stuff was still good at Triple-A with a 94.8 MPH seamer and a plethora of secondaries that missed some bats and induced weak contact. I’m also docking Tidwell much more than Mathews/Sproat, but a part of me is seeing some picking and choosing with these evaluations. I would be careful about giving up on Tidwell so far, or conversely, maybe be careful about crowning Sproat and Mathews. Or maybe a little of both. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.36/1.37/34 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.13/1.31/144 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5181347150259068,0.6321243523316062,0.6062176165803108,0.6528497409326425,59.18,52.0,,0.0,41.02564102564102,3,0.75,33.74273504273504,50.27695726495726,1.0,MLB,-3.8722223000000007,96.46666760000001,70.0,62.10208731948718,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,58.23927281376923,31701,playerId

Drafted by the Royals in the third round of the 2022 MLB Draft, he thrived immediately after turning pro, earning Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors for Kansas City in 2023. Headlining a prospect package sent to the Athletics in the Lucas Erceg deal at the 2024 Trade Deadline, the right-hander joined Double-A Midland and anchored the RockHounds' rotation -- posting a 2.61 ERA in seven starts with 52 strikeouts in 41 1/3 innings -- all the way to an appearance in the Texas League championship. In all, Barnett combined for a 4.20 ERA in 26 games (25 starts) between Double-A Northwest Arkansas and Midland and finished with 161 strikeouts and 49 walks across 133 innings. Barnett leads a four-pitch mix with his fastball. Though it may not reach the 99 mph it once did earlier in his career, he can still rev it up to about 96 mph while sitting around 94. His mid-80s slider has evolved into more of a sweeper with good bite and emerged as a strong secondary pitch, providing solid separation in velocity from his upper-70s curve. He also utilizes a mid-80s changeup that is especially effective against left-handed batters. Listed at 6-foot and 218 pounds, Barnett is showing all the traits of a “bulldog” on the mound who goes right after opposing hitters. He demonstrated strong improvement in his overall strike-throwing ability with his cleaned-up three-quarters arm slot that at times got a little long in the past. If the improvements hold up at the next level, the A’s view him as a long-term starter and believe he could push his way up to the big leagues at some point in 2025.

He’s a thick 6’0”, 218 pounds with a mid 90’s fastball that has good life, a plus slider, good curve, and a decent changeup. He’s not a control artist, but he’s far from wild. He caught fire in the 2nd half of the season with a 2.03 ERA and 30.0/9.3 K%/BB% in his last 84.1 IP at Double-A. There is some bullpen risk, but that lessens considerably with how wide open Oakland’s rotation is, and he checks plenty of boxes (good size, velocity, swing and miss, diverse pitch mix). The coming ballpark downgrade definitely makes me a little more hesitant to go after him than if they were sticking in Oakland, but Barnett definitely qualifies for that pitching prospect aisle that I love to shop in, and he gets a clear opportunity boost. – 2025 Projection: 4/4.29/1.34/91 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.92/1.28/150 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.13471502590673579,0.27461139896373055,0.27979274611398963,0.20725388601036268,21.79,69.23076923076923,,,61.53846153846154,2,0.5,55.03205128205128,33.42471794871794,1.0,MLB,-3.2861112000000006,89.4333344,55.0,35.42691554461538,25.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,41.07877887507692,31741,playerId

The transition has gone well, as he performed well in Double-A and the Arizona Fall League to cap his first full pro season and won All-Star accolades and a championship in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in his second. He led the PCL with 12 victories and strikeout rate (24 percent) while ranking second in ERA (3.83) and fourth in strikeouts (128 in 124 2/3 innings). Blubaugh operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that tops out at 97 and comes out of a high arm slot with armside run and carry that keeps it off barrels. His most effective secondary pitch is a low-80s changeup with fade and depth. Houston has helped him develop a sweeping low-80s slider that elicits chases but gets pounded when he leaves it over the plate, and he also has an upper-70 curveball with similar issues and a mid-80s cutter. A basketball and football standout as an Ohio prepster, Blubaugh has the athleticism to repeat his upright delivery with a long arm action in back. With a little more refinement of his arsenal, control and command, he could be a No. 4 starter in the big leagues. If that doesn't happen, he'll likely be a spot starter and multi-inning reliever.

The good part is that the 24.3/6.2 K%/BB% and 4.05 xFIP looks really solid. K/BB is King for pitchers, so that alone tells me that I think Zebby will be fine. But I have some concerns, and those concerns are that his heavily used 94.9 MPH fastball wasn’t nearly as good in the majors as it was the minors, and that his stuff got hit really damn hard in both the majors and Triple-A, leading to a 6.69 ERA in 37.2 MLB IP, and a 5.68 ERA in 19 AAA IP. His fastball put up a 94.3 MPH EV against in the majors and a 93 MPH EV against at Triple-A. His 2nd most used pitch, the slider, also got hit really hard at both stops with a 90.2 MPH EV against in the majors and a 94.7 MPH EV against at Triple-A. He had a 14% Barrel% against in the majors, which is wildly bad. His slider and changeup both missed bats, we know how good his control is with a ridiculous 7 walks in 97 IP in the minors, and this was just his first taste of the majors after starting the season at High-A. He definitely deserves some grace to have an adjustment period, especially because he was reaching a career high in IP, and the strong K/BB rate gives added confidence that he will figure it out. It’s just that I feel his reasonable upside projection drops from maybe a #2 to a #3. – 2025 Projection: 8/4.26/1.31/121 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.77/1.24/180 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9378238341968912,0.8808290155440415,0.9041450777202072,0.9222797927461139,91.19,,,,83.4319526627219,1,0.25,64.65976331360946,81.90441715976331,1.0,MLB,-2.8277778,83.9333336,40.0,87.315825187929,30.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,59.57878805456805,31827,playerId

The 4-seamer sits mid to upper 90’s, and while it’s not a huge bat missing weapon without tons of vertical break, he also throws a mid to upper 90’s sinker which pounds the ball into the dirt. He can start throwing the sinker more, and he can also work on the movement profile of the 4-seamer now that he’s healthy. The real money maker is the truly elite slider. It put up a 50% whiff% in 11.2 IP in the majors and a 71.4% whiff% in 10 IP at Triple-A. He rounds out the arsenal with a lesser used changeup, and how good he can get that pitch could be a big factor in just how high the upside will end up. Digging into the nitty gritty of his pitch mix is almost besides the point though, because staying healthy is essentially the only thing he needs to do. The Mets drafted him 10th overall and didn’t sign him because they didn’t like his medicals. He then underwent shoulder surgery shortly after that, but looked so good in Independent ball when he returned from the surgery, that the Rangers selected him 3rd overall the next year. Which he followed up with Tommy John in 2023, returning for the 2nd half of 2024, where he put up a 1.96 ERA with a 39.6/3.6 K%/BB% in 36.2 IP at mostly AA and AAA. It’s about as risky of a health profile as it gets, but all pitchers are so risky, that I don’t want to discount him too much because of it. I’ll take on extra risk when the upside is a true ace. The downside could be a high leverage reliever though if he keeps getting hurt. 2025 Projection: 9/3.71/1.20/146 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.35/1.13/190 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5025906735751295,0.5803108808290155,0.6424870466321244,0.616580310880829,57.43,,,,95.85798816568047,1,0.25,74.28994082840235,63.33097928994083,0.8,MLB,-2.3277778,77.9333336,35.0,62.27579382698225,35.0,0.5719999999999998,Mixed,45.36077394214202,31843,playerId

He put up a 7.50 ERA with a 27.2/13.6 K%/BB% in 18 IP. The fastball was down to 94.1 MPH. The good news is that the secondaries (changeup, curve, slider) still missed a ton of bats and induced weak contact, and he also pitched much better at Double-A with a 1.10 ERA and 29.0/3.2 K%/BB% in 16.1 IP. We can give him a pass for his performance at Triple-A due to the injury, but Tommy John surgery knocked out his entire 2021 season, so injuries are starting to become a concern. He’s never pitched more than 88.1 IP in a season, so it’s a question if he can truly put up a full starter’s workload year after year, and also what level of stuff he can hold over those innings. His value took a hit this year, but it would be too risk averse to completely tank his value. I’m holding relatively strong. 2025 Projection: 4/4.13/1.32/74 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.68/1.19/163 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4196891191709845,0.7098445595854922,0.24870466321243523,0.5181347150259067,47.87,,,,87.77120315581854,1,0.25,68.02268244575936,54.92343885601578,0.8,MLB,-4.0722223,98.8666676,35.0,57.63553179680473,35.0,0.5719999999999998,Mixed,47.45932282856213,31872,playerId

He put up a 7.49 ERA with a 13.9/13.3 K%/BB% in 33.2 IP. And quite frankly, there are no silver linings. None of his pitches were good. The fastball in particular got destroyed. The slider was the only pitch to perform halfway decently. And worst of all, his elite control from the minors was nowhere to be found, probably because he didn’t want to throw the ball over the plate with how easily his stuff was getting crushed. He didn’t only get hit up in the majors, he also didn’t pitch well at Triple-A with a 6.20 ERA in 61 IP, although at least it came with a 60/13 K/BB. Plus control of a 94.6 MPH fastball with a diverse pitch mix and an above average slider is a good profile in theory, but in practice, it’s clearly not working. The fastball is way too hittable despite the good velocity. He looks like a back end arm right now. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.50/1.41/64 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 6/4.21/1.34/112 in 130 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5854922279792747,0.22279792746113988,0.8497409326424871,0.47668393782383417,52.53,,,,33.925049309664686,1,0.25,26.291913214990128,43.34666962524655,1.0,MLB,-3.738888899999999,94.86666679999999,40.0,56.125500907573965,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,47.72980876840828,31900,playerId

He fits the mold of finesse pitchers whom the Guardians have excelled at helping upgrade their stuff, and they signed him for $1.3 million as a 2022 second-rounder. While he hasn't added any velocity as a pro, he ranked fifth in the Minors last year with 165 strikeouts in 133 2/3 innings and was named a Double-A Eastern League All-Star after posting a 2.06 ERA in 15 outings there. Messick's great equalizer is his tumbling low-80s changeup, which elicits plenty of chase and swings and misses, along with well-above-average grades from some evaluators. It helps him miss bats with his low-90s fastball, which also benefits from a flat approach angle and good carry up in the zone. He has mostly scrapped his upper-70s curveball and turned what had been an upper-70s slider into a more cutterish mid-80s version that played as an average offering last year. Though the 6-foot, 225-pound Messick is more burly than athletic, he repeats his delivery well and provides consistent strikes. He hides the ball well and isn't afraid to challenge hitters with his less-than-overpowering arsenal. Similar to Joey Cantillo but with more strike-throwing ability, he offers a high floor as at least a back-of-the-rotation starter.

I still think he’s a back end starter, but every higher level he’s able to miss bats at that pace is a slightly better chance that he could reach that #4 starter upside, which would make him fantasy relevant.

He became the earliest drafted pitcher from the program when the Pirates took him No. 36 overall in the 2022 Draft, and he’s climbed the ladder relatively quickly, reaching Triple-A in his second full season and leading the organization in K/BB ratio for the second straight season while also topping all Pirates pitching prospects in BB/9 and WHIP. Sometimes lost in the shadow of the premium stuff coming from right-handers like Paul Skenes, Jared Jones and Bubba Chandler, Harrington combines solid stuff with an easily plus feel for pitching. He has as many as five pitches in his arsenal, and he’s not afraid to pull any arrow from his quiver. While his fastball averages between 92-93 mph and tops out at 95, it plays up because of its run and carry. He backs the fastball up with an array of secondary offerings, with his 83-84 mph sweeper with excellent spin rates the best of his breaking balls. His 84-85 mph splitter with tumble also serves as an above-average pitch that misses bats. His upper-80s cutter provides a shorter power breaker that plays well off of his sweeper, and he uses a low-80s curve effectively as well. Helping all of his pitches play up is Harrington’s ability to fill the strike zone, as he was one of the best in the Minors in strike percentage in 2024, and he’s adept at keeping hitters off-balance with his pitch mix. He has as high a floor as a future big league starter as anyone in the system as a result.

None of his pitches really missed enough bats at Triple-A to get really overly excited, but they generally induced weak contact, and a 22.5% whiff% on the fastball, 30.0% whiff% on the changeup, and 33.3% whiff% on the lesser used curve isn’t that bad.

He was limited to only 10 appearances between the Florida Complex and Florida State Leagues in 2023 and then erupted onto the scene in his second full season. He rose from Single-A St. Lucie to Double-A Binghamton while posting a 3.03 ERA and 1.17 WHIP. His 160 strikeouts were the most by a Mets farmhand while his 34.2 percent K rate ranked fifth among all Minor League qualifiers. Standing at 6-foot-1, Tong can look like the second coming of Tim Lincecum with his deceptive over-the-top delivery and good extension. His fastball only shows average velocity in the 91-94 mph range, but it plays well above that with elite induced vertical break (averaging above 20 inches in front of Statcast cameras in the FSL). He plays off that high pitch with a 74-76 mph curveball that he can drop in (with above 65 inches of vertical drop) for early strikes or tunnel off the heater for a K. He leaned on his 82-84 mph cut slider early in 2024 as he was looking to hone the pitch, but a 84-86 mph changeup (thrown with a Vulcan grip) was better at generating whiffs as a rare armside offering for him. He's increased his usage with the cambio in 2025, following a slight shift in where he held the baseball, and has held that swing-and-miss rate. Tong’s walk rate crept up as he went level to level, and it moved up again a touch in 2025. There is some concern that more advanced batters can lay off his north-south approach and that his unorthodox delivery will be difficult to maintain as he ages. But for now, Tong has the momentum and interesting profile of a pitcher who could climb into an MLB rotation by 2026, especially if the strikeouts keep coming.

Talk about making a statement. The low to mid 90’s fastball will play just fine. Here he is blowing a fastball by Spencer Jones . Granted, I think I could strikeout Spencer Jones right now, but still. It wasn’t just Jones, it was everyone . Showing that level of dominance in the upper minors was a big hurdle to clear.” … He wasn’t as good in his 2nd start at the level (and final start of the season) with 3 ER and a 5/4 K/BB in 3.1 IP, but we already knew that below average control is a weakness in his game. Seeing the stuff so clearly fully translate was exciting. The breaking ball is absolutely filthy, the bat missing fastball can be a plus pitch despite the mediocre velocity, and he rounds out the arsenal with a cutter and changeup. If he can improve him control/command, Tong could be a beast, and even if he can’t, he can be a high K, mid rotation starter. I’m definitely in on him. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 11/3.71/1.27/174 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9896373056994818,0.9896373056994818,0.4455958549222798,0.9792746113989638,86.7,92.0,75.0,,66.86390532544378,3,0.75,70.90110511660284,81.170386790811,1.0,MLB,-5.875,100.0,70.0,87.0361160372433,20.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,70.16625221675949,32157,playerId

Like Chandler, Morales is a huge talent ($3 million signing bonus in 2023), with a scouts dream build at 6’3”, 190 pounds (although Chandler was more built up and wider), super obvious humongous stuff, below average control, and mediocre results at High-A. Morales put up a 4.22 ERA with a 24.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 81 IP at the level while Chandler put up a 4.75 ERA with a 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% in 106 IP at the level. Just because Chandler exploded to elite prospect status in 2024 doesn’t mean Morales will, but that high end outcome is definitely in the cards. Morales’ delivery is so easy and athletic it almost lulls you into a false sense of security before he fires off a mid to upper 90’s fastball, a potentially plus breaking ball, and a promising, but still developing changeup. He can definitely still look pretty raw on the mound, making the bullpen a very possible destination long term, but this is the type of upside you want to chase. I was relatively high on Morales in his FYPD year, and I’m going to remain high on him headed into 2025. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.78/1.29/168 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.616580310880829,0.7305699481865285,0.533678756476684,0.7150259067357513,64.62,,,,63.90532544378698,1,0.25,49.526627218934905,59.337319526627226,1.0,MLB,-5.1666667,100.0,40.0,68.34219585798817,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,54.25398813609468,32227,playerId

Before getting to baseball, this is what most coaches and evaluators start with when Bloss is mentioned: his intelligence. Success has followed on the diamond, though, as Bloss shot from High-A to the big leagues with the Astros in 2024 before being traded to the Blue Jays as part of the Yusei Kikuchi deal. Bloss didn’t exactly hit the ground running with the Blue Jays organization, posting a 6.91 ERA over 27 1/3 innings at Triple-A Buffalo, but his cumulative ‘24 line in the Minors looks much cleaner, with a 3.18 ERA and 88 strikeouts over 93 1/3 innings pitched. Bloss thinks about the game at an extremely advanced level and has made use of the Blue Jays' many resources, diving into the data of his pitches to tinker away. While his fastball sits 93-94 mph, he reached up to the 97-98 mph range early in Spring Training, and he has a curveball that has grown since he made the move to pro ball. Bloss also throws a couple of variations of his slider, adjusting speeds and the depth of its break. Bloss started slowly out of the gate again to begin his first full season in the Toronto organization with a 6.46 ERA and 1.94 WHIP over six starts with Buffalo. He left a May 3 start early, and 10 days later, the Jays announced that he needed right elbow surgery to repair his ulnar collateral ligament. That pushes back a return to the Majors until 2026 at the earliest, but before Bloss can get to The Show, he’ll need to show his stuff and command can also come back to 2024 form after a lengthy period of recovery and rehab.

He throws a diverse 5 pitch mix, and his sweeper stands out the most as a bat missing weapon in both the majors (44.4% whiff%) and AAA (38.5% whiff%). None of his pitches are really standout though, and his control has been average to below average throughout his career. He wasn’t all that great in the minors either with a 23.3/9.5 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP.

He only had one full season with the Gators (2021), sandwiched between the pandemic in '20 and Tommy John surgery in '22. His size, stuff and left-handedness still intrigued the Pirates enough to take him in the second round that summer. He came back in July 2023, and pitched his way from High-A Greensboro to Double-A Altoona in '24, with a stress response in his left shin ending his season in late July. The Pirates were thrilled with how Barco, a physical 6-foot-4 left-hander, looked in 2024 further removed from elbow surgery, especially given that he spent most of it pitching in hitter-friendly Greensboro. His fastball now sits around 93 mph and touches 95-96, more like it did pre-TJ. It has good sink, getting ground-ball outs and missing a fair amount of bats, too. His low-80s slider is an out pitch, but perhaps his biggest development was the scrapping of his changeup for a splitter as his offspeed offering. It’s had inconsistent direction at times, but it’s an absolute spin-killer with RPMs under 1,000, giving him another bat-misser and worm-killer. Overall, Barco has done a nice job of finding the strike zone, though improved command of that splitter would make that an even more effective arrow in his quiver. The gloves could come off more this year, and it wouldn’t surprise anyone if he’s knocking on the door to Pittsburgh by the end of it.

No injury is good, but it’s not an arm injury, so I’m not concerned. He throws a low to mid 90’s fastball from a deceptive lefty delivery, to go along with a plus slider and a pretty good splitter. He generally attacks zone with average control.

The Rockies literally don’t prepare their pitchers at all for eventually pitching with different air. That makes total sense to me based on how bad their franchise is. If I was heading up a franchise where the ballpark had different air, and their entire history of pitching in that environment was nothing short of horrific, the strategies necessary to thrive in that environment would run deep throughout my organization from rookie ball on up. Dollander answered the question as if nobody has even mentioned it to him ha. I just find that kinda wild. Now, maybe trying to change who you are as a pitcher would only get in your head, and maybe there literally is no good strategy for it, so I guess you might as well not think about it. I’m open to that being the case, but either way, for fantasy purposes, it just reinforces that I’m never going to be the high guy on Colorado pitching prospects, It sure seems like if anyone can slay the beast, it will be Dollander, and as a baseball fan, I’m rooting for him hardcore to be the one who breaks through. A true ace at Coors would be awesome. If we forget about Coors for a second, Dollander is an elite pitching prospect on his own merits with a 2.59 ERA and 33.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 118 IP at High-A and Double-A (he was equally dominant at both stops). The mid to upper 90’s fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon, which he combines with a 3 secondaries (gyro slider, curve, change) that aren’t as good as the fastball, but can be above average to plus pitches in their own right. Below average control is the only other demerit besides Coors Field. I’ve had a zero tolerance policy for Coors pitching prospects my entire life, and it has yet to come back to bite me. Maybe Dollander will be the one to finally make me regret it, and I’m genuinely rooting for him to be the one, even if it won’t happen on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 4/4.28/1.33/96 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.79/1.24/185 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3212435233160622,0.5647668393782384,0.1658031088082902,0.36787564766839376,36.21,,,,88.95463510848126,1,0.25,68.93984220907296,47.66544477317554,0.825,MLB,-4.255555600000001,100.0,35.625,49.215133431952665,34.375,0.5182499999999998,Mixed,44.1155600443787,33482,playerId

He put up a 3.47 ERA with a 23.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. Those K/BB numbers are not very impressive against minor league competition, and he was atrocious in the majors with a 16.71 ERA and 8.3/22.8 K%/BB% in 7 IP. The devasting splitter lived up to the hype and is definitely an at least plus bat missing weapon, but that seems to really be all he has. The fastball sits in the mid 90’s, but it doesn’t miss many bats, the slider is average at best, and the control is well below average.

Much like in his time with the Bobcats, Garcia showed he could miss bats with his stuff, even if he didn’t always know where it was going. Taking a flyer on a lefty like this on Day 3 of the Draft is not uncommon, but what has been surprising is that not only did the Mariners take Garcia in the 11th round of the ‘23 Draft, they let him start throughout his first full season. Garcia ran with the opportunity, pitching his way to Double-A and leading the organization in ERA (2.25) and K/9 (10.4) in 2024. He moved to the bullpen for good in his age-25 season in ’25 and rose to the Majors just before he was traded to the D-backs in the Josh Naylor deal. A terrific late bloomer story, the 6-foot-4 Garcia seems to be getting better the more mound time he gets, and his stuff was ticking up in the shorter role. His heavy two-seam fastball sits 96-98 mph and touches 100 with a ton of sink. From a low three-quarter slot, he works east-west off that with a mid-80s sweeper that averaged 15.4 inches of glove side movement at Triple-A -- equal to the arm side run of the sinker -- and generated a ton of swing-and-miss. He also has a sharper upper-80s hard slider/cutter that serves as his option for righties. That’s much needed since his changeup stays in the back pocket. Garcia’s lack of a changeup and his overall command, along with his advanced age, led to the move to the bullpen as he entered his mid-20s. That sinker-sweeper combo, however, should be enough to keep him in the bigs, especially if he can be limited to lefty-heavy appearances in the desert.

After he tied a Cavaliers record with 12 victories and winning most outstanding player honors at the Charlottesville Regional in 2023, the Red Sox drafted him in the fifth round. He added fastball velocity in his first full pro season, which made his quality changeup even more effective and helped him rank second in the system with 138 strikeouts in 103 2/3 innings while climbing to Double-A. Added strength boosted Early's fastball from 89-91 mph at Virginia to 92-94 with a high of 96 in 2024, and it bores down and in against right-handers. His lively low-80s changeup has similar action, and he can land it for strikes or use it as a chase pitch. He also can keep batters off balance with a pair of breaking balls, a sweeping low-80s slider that has become a solid offering and an upper-70s curveball. Early can't overpower hitters but has the feel to provide consistent strikes without catching too much of the plate. He throws his fastball just one third of the time, just enough to keep hitters honest and set up his secondary pitches, and his heater may need more velocity or life at higher levels. He's probably not more than a back-of-the-rotation option, but he may have the highest floor among Red Sox starting pitching prospects.

The Orioles took him in the third round in 2022 but did not sign him after a concerning MRI, so McLean returned to post a .911 OPS and a 3.30 ERA in Stillwater. The Mets selected him in the third round in 2023 and allowed the former Cowboy to be a two-way player up until late June 2024 after he struck out 52.2 percent of the time through 17 games as a Double-A hitter. McLean finished with a 3.78 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 109 2/3 innings between High-A and Double-A. Now with his focus fully on the mound, McLean could be cleared for major takeoff in his second full season. He held his velocity well in Year 1, averaging 94-96 mph while topping out at 98, much as he did in college. There is some flat approach to his four-seamer out of his low release, and he gets ample armside movement on a sinker as well, leading to heavy groundball rates. The real monster is his 84-87 mph sweeper – a pitch with elite spin and horizontal movement averaging around 15-16 inches with Triple-A Syracuse. McLean can use the pitch well running away from righties or backfooting it to lefties. His 88-90 mph cutter bridges the gap between the two offerings, and he also mixes in an upper-80s changeup and a high-spin upper-70s curveball for a more complete arsenal. McLean’s walk rates were a touch high in 2024 but were consistent level-to-level. That had held in 2025, even as he's moved to the Major League ball in Triple-A, and then they actually improved as he gained confidence in the Majors. Mets officials point out that he’s an ultimate competitor on the bump who tries to blow by hitters as much as he can. Settling into more of a routine has only helped his case as a starter -- and a standout one at the top level.

He turned down the Orioles after signability worries dropped him to the 18th round in 2022, then turned pro with the Guardians as a supplemental second-rounder in 2023. He logged a 2.32 ERA between Double-A and Triple-A while breaking into pro ball last year, then compiled a 0.77 mark in 13 appearances with Cleveland, including the playoffs. Walters used his fastball 82 percent of the time in college and 65 percent of the time in his pro debut, but hitters still can't do anything with it. His heater averages 95-97 mph and touches 99, playing better than its velocity thanks to its carry, command and deception. His mid-80s slider improved last year as he used it more often, and it plays as a plus pitch in part because batters have to focus on his fastball. After answering questions about whether such a heater-heavy approach would work in pro ball, Walters could become a closer in the future. To do so, he'll have to improve his walk rate after it tripled from 4 percent in his final two seasons with the Hurricanes to 12 percent last year. He creates extension in his delivery that makes him even tougher to hit, and he's equally effective against lefties and righties Last Prospect 20 Aaron Walton Next Prospect 22 Robert Arias Guardians Prospect Headlines Led by Bazzana, Guards' NRI list includes top prospects, familiar faces January 30, 2026 Guards land six players among Top 100 Prospects, led by Bazzana January 23, 2026 3 Guardians prospects who could find their way to the bigs in '26 January 22, 2026 Guardians acquire pitching prospect Gomez from Mets for international bonus pool money January 15, 2026 Guardians stock up on switch-hitting shortstops as int'l signing period opens January 15, 2026 How DeLauter's postseason debut could position him for big '26 December 22, 2025 These 10 teams have the prospects to swing a big trade at the Winter Meetings December 2, 2025 Guards' No. 3 prospect among those protected; Enright DFA'd November 18, 2025 More Prospects News Guardians Prospect Highlights 01:07 Breaking down #20 prospect Travis Bazzana January 23, 2026 00:44 Breaking down #46 prospect Chase DeLauter January 23, 2026 04:24 Parker Messick on learning from the 2025 season January 23, 2026 06:23 Chase DeLauter on his MLB debut, Rookie Program January ",False,,none,46.15384615384615,,False,,,,,,,,,,False,,,none,0.0,,,,,,,Andrew Walters,CLE,P,25.0,17.0,11.0,83.0,100.0,0.435,,,23.5,35.1,86.6,,,,12.5,23.5,29.0,36.6,49.398,80.8,81.0,18.1,,0.364,0.529,0.455,0.5,4.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,41.0,15.0,113.3,98.0,12.5,,,,,none,0,0.40414507772020725,0.9844559585492227,0.015544041450777257,0.8082901554404145,54.64,28.57142857142857,,,,1,0.25,22.14285714285714,43.266,0.375,MLB,-3.3722223000000007,90.46666760000001,24.375,56.60180014000001,45.625,0.5549999999999999,Mixed,41.595393583,33834,playerId

New York did -- this time in the second round -- and signed him for slot at $1,474,500 after striking out 134 in 106 1/3 innings at Florida in 2023. Sproat flew through the Mets system in his first season, climbing from High-A Brooklyn to Triple-A Syracuse while posting a 3.40 ERA and fanning 131 in 116 1/3 innings. He was back in Syracuse for ’25, made four MLB starts in September and then was traded to the Brewers in January as part of the Freddy Peralta/Tobias Myers return. The 6-foot-3 right-hander’s fastball stands out more for its velocity than its shape. Sproat will run the four-seamer up to triple-digits on occasion and continued to sit in the 95-98 mph range even late in the season at Triple-A. But there isn’t great ride on the pitch, and batters at the Minors’ top level took advantage, hitting .380 off the fastball alone. Sproat can also work in a sinker around the same velo band, and the extra look helps generate a lot of groundball contact. His upper-80s changeup gets the right amount of separation and fade to give the former Gator a weapon against lefties, and after early struggles in 2025, he's leaned on the pitch more to right himself. Sproat works with both an 84-86 mph sweeper and harder 88-90 mph slider. The former is better at generating whiffs. A 79-81 mph curveball offers another occasional breaker. Sproat was control over command in his first taste of the Minors. He kept walk rates generally in check, but Triple-A batters proved they could bang pitches he leaves too much over the plate. That said, Sproat has the velocity and pitch mix to feature as a starter, and his ground-ball tendencies should be a good fit as a potential No. 3/4 starter for a Milwaukee club that prioritizes infield defense.

They love to use minor leaguers as guinea pigs, which I get, but life would be a lot easier if things were at least a bit more standardized among all levels. There was literally different rules for calling balls and strikes at Triple-A in the first 3 games of a series (fully automated) vs. the last 3 (umps call it with a automated challenge system). Then they switched the rules mid-season to just the automated challenge system with the umps calling them the rest of the time. Every level also uses different balls. Triple-A uses the MLB ball, while lower levels don’t. Enter Brandon Sproat, who utterly dominated at Double-A with a 2.45 ERA and 33.2/6.5 K%/BB% in 62.1 IP, only to completely fall apart at Triple-A with a 7.53 ERA and 16.3/8.5 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP. Was it the ball? Was it the strikezone? Was it the better competition? Was it that he was reaching a career high in IP? Was it a combo of everything? I don’t know exactly, but what I do know is that the stuff was still nasty. The 4-seamer sits 96.6 MPH and he has 2 potentially plus secondaries in his slider and changeup which both miss bats and induce weak contact. He also throws a cutter, curve and sinker, giving him a very diverse pitch mix. His control was below average throughout his college career, and it also was poor at the start of the season at High-A, so there is still some control/command risk in here even though he took a big step forward in that department overall. Does it worry me a bit that his numbers tanked so hard when he used the MLB baseball for the first time? It does. But at the end of the day the stuff don’t lie, and Sproat has monster stuff. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.08/1.32/87 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.63/1.20/189 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.383419689119171,0.21761658031088082,0.4818652849740933,0.23834196891191708,33.5,80.0,0.0,,88.75739644970415,3,0.75,55.570831883049074,41.22479115906718,1.0,MLB,-3.1472222999999993,87.76666759999999,70.0,43.95743748772015,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,48.33418038947407,33850,playerId

He was the conference’s top arm again in 2023 and one of the best in the country, leading to him being the second pitcher taken in that summer’s Draft behind No. 1 pick Paul Skenes. The No. 7 overall selection started his pro career in 2024 with High-A Dayton and ended it with some early success in the big leagues. The right-hander has long had a reputation for his advanced feel for pitching, so much so that his stuff often gets short shrift. His fastball averaged around 93-94 mph at all levels in 2024, topping out at 96-97 and he throws both a four- and a two-seamer, the latter featuring solid sink to elicit a good amount of ground-ball outs. He has an outstanding changeup, thrown 86-87 mph with a ton of fade and to both sides of the plate when at its best, though he didn’t throw it as much nor was it quite as effective as during his junior year at Wake Forest. He’s leaned more on his mid-80s slider as a pro, throwing it as often as his four-seamer during his big league debut. One thing the Reds can be sure of is that Lowder is going to be in the strike zone consistently. He repeats his three-quarters arm slot and delivery extremely well and continues to be seen as the pitching prospect with the best pitchability in the game. He showed the ability to make adjustments and succeed as he climbed the ladder quickly, something he’s sure to do when he settles into the big league rotation.

He put up a 3.64 ERA with a 25.3/5.4 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at mostly Double-A, and then he got the call to the bigs and held his own with a 1.17 ERA (4.25 xERA) with a 17.2/10.9 K%/BB% in 30.2 IP. I trust the K/BB and xERA more than the ERA, but even with the underlying numbers being lackluster, there were other positive takeaways from the debut. Namely his 93.5 MPH fastball put up a very good 27.8% whiff%. Plus control of a good fastball is a very strong foundation, and Lowder is more than just that with a legit 4 pitch mix. The slider and changeup were less impressive in the majors, and he wasn’t putting up big strikeout numbers in the minors, so development of those secondaries will be huge to unlock more upside. As is, he projects as a solid mid rotation starter, but there is definitely upside for more. – 2025 Projection: 5/4.11/1.31/106 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.72/1.16/177 in 175 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7512953367875648,0.5595854922279793,0.8704663212435233,0.7772020725388601,72.88,84.0,57.14285714285714,,83.62919132149902,3,0.75,70.2520428289659,71.96021499013807,0.22749999999999998,MLB,-4.622222300000001,100.0,50.6875,76.67206449704142,39.3125,0.5490999999999999,Mixed,58.74305402366864,33876,playerId

He’s 6’3”, 230 with a mid 90’s fastball and a plus breaker as his best pitches. He has high spin rates on all of his pitches. He was the perfect candidate to absolutely blow up with a strong AFL showing, and while he hasn’t done that with a 9.45 ERA and 12/6 K/BB in 6.2 IP over 3 outings, he has established that his nasty stuff is legit. The fastball sits mid to upper 90’s, the slider is potentially plus, and the changeup is promising. He barely has any track record at all with a career high of 31 IP in 2022 in the SEC (52 IP if you include the 2022 Cape), so it’s a mystery if he can stay healthy or if he can maintain this level of stuff over an entire season, but pitchers take this path all the time, and the stuff is undeniable. He definitely has some hype, so his price could vary depending on the league, but I would be more than happy to take a shot on Taylor if you are looking for a high upside arm. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.31/148 in 140 IP Update: He’s looked fire this spring and has been untouchable",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9948186528497409,0.9792746113989638,0.4559585492227979,0.9740932642487047,86.73,,,,77.90927021696253,1,0.25,60.37968441814595,77.50738954635108,0.755,MLB,-4.8222223,100.0,33.875,85.95371686390533,36.125,0.6228499999999999,Mixed,60.035422588757385,33927,playerId

After signing for $2.5 million as the 24th overall choice, he developed the best all-around stuff in the Minors -- but he didn't pitch in an official game between April 2022 and September 2025. Initially sidelined by knee tendinitis, he developed shoulder soreness while rehabbing. He has had two shoulder surgeries since, getting a muscle strain and capsule tear repaired in May 2023 and damage to his shoulder capsule and rotator cuff fixed in March 2024. When last seen on the mound, Espino had a four-seam fastball that sat at 95-98 mph with a high of 103 with armside run, and he could blow it by Double-A hitters wherever he wanted in the strike zone. He also exhibited nice feel for a power slider, displaying the aptitude to spin it in the mid-80s with two-plane depth or push it up to 93 mph with more horizontal action. His low-80s curveball and mid-80s changeup with sink weren't as consistent but operated as solid pitches when they were on. Espino's combination of athleticism and strength allowed him to generate explosive stuff with little effort. He continued to improve his control and command as he rose through the Minors and was on the verge of joining the Guardians at age 21. He had all the ingredients to become a No. 1 starter but now he's a total wild card.

If you said eff it with Kumar Rocker and held onto him, it would have paid off in a major way for you this year. Rocker had both shoulder and elbow surgeries. Granted, Espino’s shoulder problems seem way more serious with him missing all of 2024 with another shoulder surgery. He hasn’t pitched since 2022. But his stuff was so off the charts nasty with upper 90’s heat, a plus slider, and a diverse pitch mix, that I think it’s worth it to just say eff it. Maybe he’s a shell of his former self. Maybe he keeps getting hurt. Or maybe he ends up in the bullpen. But on the off chance that his shoulder actually does get back to full health, he has the potential to Kumar Rocker the minors. From an afterthought to an elite, hyped pitching prospect in the blink of an eye. I’m going to hold on to see where it goes. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 3/3.81/1.29/65 in 60 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9495798319327731,0.20168067226890757,0.9915966386554622,0.907563025210084,74.41,0.0,,,57.1992110453649,2,0.5,28.36127547666009,58.29294641683103,0.005,0–1 yr,-1.4472223,67.3666676,30.125,68.5183840650493,49.875,0.5904499999999999,Mixed,42.85035634927219,sa3011495,playerId

Macko was acquired from the Mariners as a smaller piece in the Erik Swanson deal, but has developed into one of the system’s highest-upside arms since then. After coming on strong down the stretch in 2023, Macko posted a 4.63 ERA in ‘24 with 105 strikeouts over 93 1/3 innings, climbing from High-A to Triple-A. The lefty was poised for a big camp in ‘25, but a bad-luck knee injury in February led to Macko undergoing arthroscopic surgery to clean up a meniscus tear. That will cut into his 2025 season significantly, but given that Macko was headed for Triple-A, he’ll still have time to make an impact if it all comes together. His fastball had started reaching the mid-90s more often and his curveball already profiles as a legitimate out pitch in the big leagues, so the upside is undoubtedly there. Macko’s slider is still a bit ahead of his changeup at this point. The knee surgery complicated what should have been a big year for Macko. He'll need a strong finish to 2025 to reposition himself for a chance at a Major League spot coming out of next spring. As much as you can chalk this up to a lost year, the Jays' increasingly deep line of arms threatens Macko's standing heading into 2026.

His development was delayed by losing all of 2020 to the pandemic and all of 2023 to recovery from Tommy John surgery, but he has emerged as one of the best starter prospects in a pitching-thin Cubs system since his return. Promoted to Double-A this July, he permitted just eight runs in his first five starts there. Schlaffer works with a fringy fastball that sits at 91-94 mph, touches 97 and features some armside run. He uses it to set up a pair of solid secondary pitches, the better of which is a low-80s curveball with power and depth. While his mid-80s changeup doesn't induce many chases, it fades so much that right-handers have a hard time making in-zone contact against it. Schlaffer isn't very physical at 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, but he gets down the mound well to create some extension. He generates his stuff more with arm speed than effort, though his control and command are just fair. He could reach Chicago as a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever in 2026.

The White Sox grabbed him in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft but returned him to Boston after he had nerve decompression surgery on his shoulder the following February. He missed three months with forearm inflammation in 2025 but logged a 2.27 ERA with 67 strikeouts in 47 2/3 innings at Triple-A when healthy, which allowed him to claim a spot on the 40-man roster in November. That effectiveness in Triple-A came because Drohan's fastball and slider were better than they had been previously in pro ball. His heater gained a tick in velocity, sitting at 93-94 mph and touching 96, and played better up in the strike zone. His mid-80s slider showed improved action, enabling it to get more chases as well as in-zone swings-and-misses. Drohan's upper-70s curveball gives him a second solid pitch, though his fading mid-80s changeup regressed and his upper-80s cutter got hammered last season. He cut his walk rate to 8 percent at Triple-A, down from 12 percent earlier in his career, and he thrived by working ahead in the count more often. He still has a ceiling of a back-of-the-rotation starter but now appears to have a greater chance of reaching it.

The Iowa high school product blew out his elbow in instructional league that fall and has totaled just 88 2/3 innings in five pro seasons since, having Tommy John surgery in 2020 and a shoulder operation in '22. Back issues delayed the start of his 2025 season but he did advance to Double-A before the Pirates selected him in the Rule 5 Draft in December, then immediately traded him to the Rangers for righty pitching prospect Jaiker Garcia and cash. Baumler displayed two plus pitches while working a career-high 39 2/3 innings last season. His fastball operated from 93-97 mph and touched 99 with explosive carry at its best. He long has shown aptitude for spinning the ball and can land his low-80s power curveball for strikes as well as get chases with it. He'll occasionally mix in a mid-80s slider, more versus righties. As a two-pitch guy with fringy control and a long medical record, Baumler will be a reliever rather than the mid-rotation starter Baltimore once envisioned. He'll have to remain on Texas' active roster throughout 2026, or else clear waivers and get offered back to the Orioles for half of his $100,000 draft price. His fastball/curveball combination should be enough for him to claim a low-leverage bullpen role, with the promise for more if he can stay healthy.

He was traded from Texas to St. Louis while on the Double-A IL in the 2023 Deadline deal for Jordan Montgomery and Chris Stratton but missed more than three months of what should have been his first full season as a Cardinal last year. The 6-foot-1 right-hander sat 94-97 mph in the Texas League before his latest stay on the shelf but was more in the 92-95 range over three Single-A rehab appearances late in the year. The heater can act like a plus pitch when the velo’s there due to a flat angle and good extension. His 80-83 mph curveball remains the best pitch in his arsenal, a real snapper that generated a ton of whiffs. He’d also show a harder slider and a low-80s changeup with tons of separation off the heat despite being a fourth pitch in terms of usage. Righties crushed Roby in 2024, especially the four-seamer if he didn’t locate it high enough in or above the zone. He’s at his best when he’s playing a north-south game with the heat and the deuce, but there’s also no grade for health. Roby threw 78 1/3 innings between Double-A and Triple-A in 2025 -- his highest mark since 2022 -- but needed Tommy John surgery in late July, a procedure that will shut him down until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.

He put up a 6.57 ERA with a 22.2/8.5 K%/BB% in 38.1 IP at mostly Double-A. He missed a large chunk of the season due to a shoulder injury, but he looked just as bad before the injury as he did when he returned from it. He can definitely bounce back in 2025 if he’s healthy with a mid 90’s fastball, plus curve, and diverse pitch mix, but he’s just not a very highly sought after pitching prospect right now.

He had developed into one of the top southpaws in the Minors and was on course to make his big league debut in 2023, but he blew out his elbow again that May and required a second elbow reconstruction a month later. The Marlins added him to the 40-man roster last November after he missed the entire 2024 season, and he should be fully healthy for this season. Fulton always has exhibited tremendous feel for spin, long featuring a plus downer curveball in the low 80s and adding a slightly harder slider with similar shape after he turned pro. He has two effective fastballs, a 93-95 mph four-seamer that climbs to 97 but can straighten out at times and a two-seamer with less velocity and more sink. His fading changeup has improved and can be an average offering, though it also can get too firm in the upper-80s. Fulton uses his 6-foot-7 frame to create plenty of extension in his delivery, and he has the athleticism to repeat his mechanics. He was making steady progress with his control and command until his elbow began acting up again in 2023. He still has the makings of a mid-rotation starter but needs to demonstrate the durability to handle the role.

Since taking him in the fourth round that year, he's run into some injury issues, with a shoulder strain keeping him on the shelf for all of the 2021 season. The next two seasons, the right-hander was on a super-cautious workload plan throwing just 127 2/3 innings combined in 2022 and 2023. Things started to click a bit more in 2024, with Raya reaching Double-A and finishing with close to 100 IP, earning a spot on the 40-man roster as a result. Raya has always excited with his pure stuff, but concerns about durability have dampened enthusiasm. He'll throw as many as six pitches at hitters, with both a four- and two-seam fastball that topped out at 97 mph and averaged over 94 in 2024. His best pitch is his plus mid-80s slider, a sweeper that misses a lot of bats. He still has a solid low-80s curve, and while his changeup wasn't used as much and was inconsistent, it still has solid characteristics. Last year, he added a 90-91 mph cutter that can be effective, though he needs to work on keeping it from blending with his sweeper. In addition to keeping his pitches distinct, Raya also needs to improve his control after walking 4.1 per nine last year. An area of focus for him this year will be his fastball command, with the belief that higher in-zone rates for his heater will bring that walk rate down. Now on the roster, it will be interesting to see how Raya responds as the workload constraints are loosened. Last Prospect 17 C.J.

Because of the pandemic, minor injuries and getting handled with care, he worked just 127 1/3 innings in his first four years a pro. He dominated early last season, striking out 39 percent of the batters he faced while reaching Double-A in June at age 21, but he blew out his elbow in his second start there and had Tommy John surgery later that month. He returned to Minor League game action in September 2025, made six Arizona Fall League starts and was traded to the Nationals for lefty Jake Bennett in December. Perales makes up for a lack of physicality with lightning-quick arm speed that generates four-seam fastballs that averaged around 99 mph in the AFL and touched 101 with a flat approach angle and huge carry up in the strike zone. He made progress with his secondary pitches last season, particularly with an upper-80s splitter that features devastating tumble when it's on. He uses both a dropping mid-80s slider and a tighter low-90s cutter, with the latter pitch improving significantly in 2024. While Perales is athletic and gets down the mound well to create extension, he's also small for a starter and throws with some effort. He looked more like a pitcher than a thrower last year, cutting his walk rate to 8 percent (down from 13 percent in his first three pro seasons) and using his secondary offerings more often rather than just dominating with his fastball. His control wasn’t back in the Fall League, but it was still early in his TJ comeback cycle. There’s a high ceiling here as a starter with a heavy dose of relief risk, if the Nats can’t help him find the zone.

It’s such a bummer as he was going full breakout and keeping it up at Double-A. He put up a 2.94 ERA with a 38.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 33.2 IP at High-A and Double-A. The stuff is electric with a plus to double plus mid to upper 90’s fastball. He made improvements to his changeup/splitter, which flashed nasty in 2024, and he rounds out the arsenal with a cutter and slider. He was a breakout candidate coming into the season because of the electric stuff, and it sure looked like the control and secondaries took real steps forward to combine with that stuff. He was on the path to be one of the most hyped pitching prospects this off-season before the injury. He wasn’t quite established enough in the upper minors for me to love taking the TJ discount on, and he’s not a big guy, so injury risk is a real downside, but the upside is certainly here, and he was on the verge of truly establishing himself.

Hence, who was added to the 40-man last offseason when he became Rule 5-eligible, is the next in line to follow them. The Arkansas native has faced durability questions throughout his career but has shown strong results, including most recently a 2.71 ERA and 109 strikeouts in 79 2/3 innings for Double-A Springfield despite working around lat/chest/shoulder issues. Hence doesn’t cut an imposing figure on the bump at 6-foot-1, but his stuff certainly puts enough fear into batters. He buzzes a 92-96 mph fastball up in the zone from a three-quarters slot and touched as high as 98 mph in the Texas League last season. His best pitch, however, is a 82-84 mph circle changeup that looks much like the heater out of the hand until it dives armside. Per Synergy Sport, the pitch had an insane 73 percent overall whiff rate and a 63 percent whiff in-zone in 2024. Hence went to his gyro slider (around the same velocity) even more often with Springfield, and he’s added back an upper-70s curveball that many scouts loved during his amateur days. Hence has kept his walk rates in check throughout his career and would have a nailed-on starter profile if not for the durability concerns. Unfortunately, those have reared their head again 2025, beginning with a rib cage injury early in the season. He’s still yet to crack 100 innings in a campaign. His upside remains tremendous, but it's becoming clearer that a path out of the bullpen might be his best chance at bringing his dominance to the Majors.

He has injury/durability issues, but almost every pitching prospect has injury/durability risk, and I feel like it’s really easy to start picking and choosing whose injury/durability issues you hand wave away, and whose you hyper focus on. Everyone has seemed to hyper focus on Hence’s issues, where a guy like Painter can literally undergo Tommy John surgery and everyone is completely good with it, nothing to see here. Jobe, Schultz, and Rocker have all dealt with injuries and haven’t racked up innings. But for Tink, his problems are like the main focus of his evaluation, and the main focus should be on his nasty stuff. Here is a twitter compilation video of Hence making hitters look absolutely silly with his changeup, both lefty and righty hitters. And that isn’t even arguably his best secondary with a gyro slider and curve that he seems to have on a string, racking up strikeouts. He combines the 3 nasty secondaries with a mid 90’s fastball that he can blow by hitters up in the zone with a good movement profile. It all led to a 2.71 ERA with a 34.1/8.1 K%/BB% in 79.2 IP. There is definitely injury as he’s battled a variety of injuries in his professional career (shoulder, chest and lat issues with year), and he’s not a particularly huge/broad guy, but they talk about him like he’s 5 foot nothing, 150 pounds. The guy is 6’1”, 195 pounds. He’s not that small. All pitchers have injury risk to me, so I’m not one to hyper focus on the injury risk. You know what you are getting into when you draft a pitching prospect, no matter how big and broad they are, they can all go down. I’m focused on Hence’s true top of the rotation upside, and I feel like there is a bit of a buying opportunity right now. 2025 Projection: 4/3.89/1.30/78 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/186 in 168 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.23333333333333328,0.375,0.2666666666666667,0.23333333333333334,28.01,40.90909090909091,,,92.70216962524654,2,0.5,60.45346213615444,39.36521174765406,0.605,1–2 yr,-1.0333334,62.4000008,45.125,36.57506364429622,34.875,0.5641999999999999,Mixed,32.7325287999333,sa3014709,playerId

The 6-foot right-hander is one of the Minor Leagues’ kings of spin. His best offering is his 74-77 mph curveball -- a sharp breaker that averaged close to 3,000 rpm in Crow’s first two Triple-A starts. The pitch comes with 5 feet of drop, and if that wasn’t enough, its ample sweep makes it even tougher to track. He’s thrown it even more than his four-seamer in the early going with Nashville, a sensible move considering he’s only 91-94 mph with the heater. It has plenty of spin itself (around 2,600 rpm), but without the velo, Crow can’t blow it (or a sinker variation) past many bats. An upper-80s slider/cutter gives another look that he can spot gloveside. Crow doesn’t much throw his changeup, and as good as it is, his curveball only goes so far to neutralize lefties. Despite some early blips with the MLB ball at Triple-A, he has a long history of landing pitches in the zone and keeping walks at bay. Assuming health, he’ll have his best shot yet at a 40-man roster spot this offseason.

The latter didn't pitch much as an amateur but quickly opened eyes by pushing his fastball to 102 mph at the instructional league in the fall of 2021. He had his best season yet in 2024, logging a 1.98 ERA and 31 percent strikeout rate at Double-A and becoming the first hurler to spin two perfect innings in the Futures Game, making it a no-brainer for Texas to protect him on its 40-man roster in November. Teodo has the filthiest stuff in the system and one of the hardest two-seamers in the game, a sinker that somehow sits at 97-99 mph, climbs to 102 and is fairly impossible to lift. His tight upper-80s slider is even more devastating, breaking straight down and generating a 58 percent swing-and-miss rate in 2024. His changeup is his worst offering and still grades as plus, operating in the upper 80s with fade and depth. Likened to the late Yordano Ventura because of his small frame, electric arsenal and lightning-fast arm speed, Teodo still has yet to harness his stuff. He's athletic but his delivery has some effort to it, so he never has provided regular strikes and his walk rate rose to a career-worst 14 percent even while he dominated last year. He has the pitches to front a rotation, but his control may land him in the bullpen, where he would have obvious closer potential.

And on the off chance he can remain a starter, the strikeout upside is there to make an impact for fantasy. He put up a 1.98 ERA with a 30.7/14.0 K%/BB% in 86.1 IP at Double-A. The fastball sits upper 90’s and the slider is double plus. He also has a lesser used changeup that does have some potential. An upper 90’s fastball with a wipeout secondary and below average control is a classic back of the bullpen profile to get excited about. If Texas makes the decision to bullpen him, he could end up in the majors before you know it. 2025 Projection: 2/3.88/1.29/32 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.42/1.19/80/32 saves in 65 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1512605042016807,0.680672268907563,0.07563025210084029,0.226890756302521,29.41,47.36842105263158,,81.3953488372093,59.368836291913205,3,0.75,55.29095035878765,38.46833262557568,0.8525,0–1 yr,-1.5555556000000017,68.66666720000002,66.3125,38.01599986767271,23.6875,0.5555749999999998,Mixed,40.54990838045272,sa3015158,playerId

He struggled with his mechanics in 2023 and struck out only 78 batters in 94 2/3 innings for High-A Fort Wayne but bounced right back a year later. The right-hander spent the entire ’24 campaign with Double-A San Antonio and finished with a 4.03 ERA and 102 K’s in 96 frames in his age-20 season. He was one of only four 20-year-olds to throw more than 90 innings at the Minors’ second-highest level, joining Caden Dana, Robby Snelling and Yu-Min Lin on the list. Standing 6-foot-3, Lizarraga has good size on the mound but doesn’t possess stellar velocity yet, averaging just 90.1 mph on his fastball in the Texas League. He can run it up to the mid-90s, and there’s decent carry on the pitch that makes it play better than that. The Padres have hoped he would add some heat as he matures, and considering he’s still only the age of a typical American college junior, that could still happen. His 75-78 mph curveball and 77-79 mph slider drew most of his whiffs down and gloveside, while his mid-80s changeup acted mostly as a show pitch to lefties. Because he isn’t overthrowing, Lizarraga should have average control out of his lower three-quarters delivery, though his walks crept up at Double-A in 2025, and his improved K numbers will help his case to remain in a starting role. Without a true plus pitch, he could really use that extra velocity sooner rather than later as he knocks on the door of the Majors. He will be Rule 5-eligible for the first time next offseason.

That doesn’t mean they weren’t able to find any talent. They nabbed Joseph in November 2019 when he was already closing in on his 19th birthday, and he wasn’t able to make his pro debut until 2021. He spent three years either in the Florida Complex League or with Single-A Augusta until 2024, when he managed to pitch his way from High-A Rome to Double-A Mississippi. It’s not difficult to figure out what Joseph, 24 for all of the 2025 season, is all about. He’s a two-pitch-only reliever who offers power and more power. His fastball sat at 98 mph in 2024 and touched triple digits, missing bats at a 36 percent clip thanks to good ride up in the zone. He unfurled his slider, topping out at 89 mph, more than his fastball and it’s easy to see why: The nasty breaking ball produced a 45 percent miss rate last year, according to Synergy. The one thing that has held Joseph back has been his control, and he enters 2025 with a career 5.9 BB/9 walk rate to go along with his 12.2 K/9 rate. He found the zone a bit more consistently to start the year, which enabled him to reach Double-A for the first time, but there’s a reason why the Braves didn’t put him on the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft and why he wasn’t taken. It’s clear his stuff would be good for the backend of a bullpen, but he won’t see any high leverage situations unless he can improve his command.

That’s taking nothing away from Seth Johnson, who's likely to impact the Phillies' big league staff in 2025, the bigger name who came to the Phillies in last year’s Gregory Soto deal with the Orioles. But Chace, signed back in 2019 for $225,000 out of Venezuela, made a huge impression with his new organization in six post-trade starts thanks to his electric stuff that missed a ton of bats while throwing more strikes, allowing him to touch Double-A for the first time. With a strong and compact 6-foot-1 frame, Chace reminds some of a young Cristian Javier with the makings of an elite-level repertoire. It starts with an invisible fastball that comes from a low release and a ton of ride up in the zone. It averaged 94.5 mph in 2024 and was up to 98 mph, missing a ton of bats along the way (41 percent miss rate last year). He backs it up with three secondary offerings in his sweeper, a hard cutter and a changeup the Phillies think could be above-average eventually. Chace had worked in more of a piggyback system with the Orioles, so he doesn’t have a ton of innings under his belt. There’s work to be done on his command; he’s walked 5.7 per nine heading into 2025, but his strike-throwing took a big step forward in 2024 (4.5 BB/9) and the Phillies think he has the chance to be a full-time starter in the big leagues in the future.

It visually looks like it’s swimming through the air, picking up speed before it blows by some poor minor league hitter. Saying it’s explosive would be an understatement. It’s been racking up strikeouts in the lower minors since 2021, and then he got his first shot at the upper minors to close out 2024, and he shined with a 3.66 ERA and 45.5/9.1 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP over 4 outings. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus slider and solid changeup. The one thing that can tank him is his control as he put up a 12% BB% in 80.1 IP on the season, and it’s been even worse than that in the past. It definitely might end up being the fatal flaw which puts him in the bullpen, and it prevents me from really going too crazy here, because I do love the stuff. Even with that risk, he’s an excellent upside pitching prospect who should come at a very reasonable price. This isn’t a comp, but think something like what DJ Herz did this year. I’m going after him. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.81/1.27/168 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1333333333333333,0.45,0.22083333333333333,0.2,25.19,73.07692307692308,,,83.23471400394477,2,0.5,67.15195595003287,39.8766845825115,0.43,1–2 yr,-1.875,72.5,40.75,36.69250537475345,39.25,0.5142999999999999,Mixed,33.274127418639054,sa3015346,playerId

It took a little while for him to gain traction, making his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2021, then spending two seasons with Single-A Clearwater, but things really started to click in 2024. He topped 100 innings pitched for a season for the first time and finished the year in Double-A, earning a spot on the organization’s 40-man roster as a result. Cabrera took a big step forward in 2024, starting with showing he can be durable with an increased workload despite his slight frame. He also has tweaked his arsenal to give him more weapons behind his two- and four-seamer, a heater that averaged almost 94 mph and topped out at around 96 last year. His 81-82 mph sweeper improved, missing bats at a 36 percent rate and grades out nearly as well as his plus changeup, averaging 86.6 mph last year while eliciting a 49 percent miss rate. He added a shorter, harder cutter, up into the upper 80s. A solid athlete on the mound, Cabrera repeats his delivery well and has a history of finding the strike zone, with a career 2.9 BB/9 rate heading into the 2025 season. He’s trending in the right direction, with more confidence he can be a starter long-term.

He reached Double-A in 2024 and was added to the 40-man roster but struggled to build on that in 2025, landing on the 60-day injured list with a shoulder issue, then getting designated for assignment in early December. The Phillies decided his upside was worth acquiring, getting him in return for Minor League pitcher Tommy McCollum at the end of the Winter Meetings. Curet’s calling card is his powerful fastball. His electric heater was still sitting in the mid-to-upper 90s and touched 99 mph after his return from the IL in 2025, featuring life up in the zone that can generate a lot of swing-and-miss despite him throwing it more than 60% of the time. His upper-80s breaking ball is another effective weapon, even moreso when hitters are geared up for his fastball and get gloveside movement instead. He’s also shown the ability to land that pitch for strikes. Perhaps the most interesting development is his changeup, which helped him find success in Montgomery and could round out a full starter’s pitch mix. But the stuff is not the question with Curet, nor is his physical ability to start. The issue is his command. He improved his strike-throwing in 2024, lowering his walk rate to 4.5 per nine, but that tracked back up to 5.0 per nine in 2025. That could eventually mean a move to the bullpen, where he has the power stuff to potentially be a high-leverage arm.

He combines the heat with a plus slider. He’s been dominating the lower minors since 2021, so it was a big deal to see him keep up the production at Double-A where he put up a 1.75 ERA with a 35.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 25.2 IP. The control is below average and he lacks a good third pitch, so it definitely looks like a reliever profile right now, but he can be an elite high leverage one. He could also very well be a short outing, two times through the order starter. Where he ends up could be decided by how healthy and effective Tampa’s rotation is when he’s ready to get the call. – 2025 Projection: 1/3.77/1.30/23 in 20 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.35/1.20/85/26 saves in 65 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3613445378151261,0.5714285714285714,0.3529411764705882,0.453781512605042,43.32,7.9999999999999964,,0.0,60.15779092702169,3,0.75,28.43477975016436,38.11017291255753,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.2749999999999986,89.29999999999998,70.0,48.65405187376726,20.0,0.5599999999999998,Mixed,50.75432334319527,sa3015446,playerId

He has thrived since arriving in full-season ball in mid-2023, logging a 2.55 ERA with 155 strikeouts in 116 2/3 innings between two Class A stops. After shoulder weakness cost him most of the first two months of last season, he went 41 2/3 consecutive frames without allowing an earned run from in the final two months. Monegro added a mid-80s slider/cutter in 2023 and it added depth and became his best pitch last year, though he fell in love with it so much that he used it 44 percent at the time. His four-seam fastball ranges from 92-96 mph early in games, but it loses velocity and lacks good shape, so he has begun using a low-90s two-seamer more often. His upper-70s curveball once ranked as the best in the system but has regressed since he started favoring his slider, while his improving upper-80s splitter/changeup is becoming an effective chase pitch. Though Monegro has size and athleticism in his favor and has toned down his delivery while improving his control, there are questions about whether he can survive as a long-term starter. He pitches backwards because his fastballs don't have much movement or deception, so he needs to find more life or add velocity as he continues to fill out his 6-foot-4 frame. If he can't, he'll probably be a slider-heavy reliever, and those concerns contributed to the Red Sox not protecting him on the 40-man roster during the offseason.

He checks a hell of a lot of boxes with size (6’4”, 180 pounds), mid 90’s velocity, diverse pitch mix, nasty secondaries, and excellent production. He put up a 2.73 ERA with a 30.8/9.8 K%/BB% in 66 IP at High-A. He has an explosive righty delivery with a mid 90s 4-seamer, 2-seamer, a nasty change, and 2 good breaking balls in his slider and curve. He’s not a finished product as he has to continue to refine his control/command and all of his secondaries, plus he hasn’t thrown that many innings in his career (76 IP was a career high this year), but all of that is way over factored into his price. He’s a pretty special talent who has done nothing but dominate for the past two years when he’s been on the mound. If he keeps it up at Double-A, his price should take a big jump in 2025.

He worked just 23 innings in his first three years as a pro because of the pandemic shutdown in 2020 and elbow inflammation in 2022, but he opened eyes by pushing his fastball to 100 mph when he pitched briefly in August 2022. His power stands out more than his finesse, so he has spent most of the last two seasons in the bullpen. Santa's lightning-fast arm generates fastballs that reach triple digits with riding action, and he'll work in the mid-90s and touch 98 mph even when he dials his velocity back to throw more strikes. His tight mid-80s slider gives him a solid second pitch, while his upper-70s curveball offers more depth but is harder for him to control. He hasn't had much success with a mid-80s changeup that sinks and fades, though he's showing improved feel for his cambio as he uses it more often in 2025. Santa carried a 15 percent walk rate through his first four pro seasons while demonstrating well-below-average control and command. He continually fell behind in counts and got hit hard when he didn't locate his power stuff well. He has provided consistent strikes at the start of this season, though he still profiles as more of a reliever than a starter.

He made some mechanical adjustments at the end of that season that paid off with a breakout last year between that level and Double-A. He led the system in wins (11) and strikeouts (138 in 110 1/3 innings), pitched in the Futures Game and claimed a spot on the the Rangers' 40-man roster. Santos' fastball added a couple of ticks of velocity in 2024, sitting at 94-96 mph and maxing out at 98 with natural cut and ride. He also tightened his mid-80s slider into a legitimate plus offering that he can throw by hitters in the zone or get them to chase. His mid-80s changeup isn't as reliable as his other two pitches, but it plummets at the plate when it's working right. Santos is just 6 feet tall and lacks physicality, but he's athletic and provides plenty of strikes from a flat approach angle. He surrendered eight homers in 10 Double-A starts, mostly on heaters that he didn't locate high enough in the zone. Once he refines his fastball command and changeup consistency, he could be a mid-rotation starter. After making just two starts for Double-A Frisco this season, Santos landed on the IL in June due to a stress reaction in his back and is expected to be out indefinitely.

He has big stuff with a plus to double plus mid 90’s fastball that misses bats and has a great movement profile. The slider is above average and it plays up because of his good control/command over it. And while he doesn’t go to the changeup that often, it flashes as a really good pitch. It all led to a 3.67 ERA with a 30.1/7.4 K%/BB% in 110.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. The ERA spiked to 4.89 at Double-A, but the 3.63 xFIP and 29.5/7.3 K%/BB% shows he got unlucky. As is, he can be a solid #3/4 starter with good K rates and a good WHIP, but if he can develop his changeup more and/or take his control up to double plus levels, he can beat that projection.

Alberto's electric arm made him a prime Rule 5 target. He relies extensively on a fastball that parks at 96-98 mph and reaches 101 with natural cutting action, and when it's at its best, hitters can't stop chasing it out of the zone. He backs it up with a mid-80s slider that features sweeping life. Alberto's 6-foot-8 build, his low three-quarters arm slot and the angle and extension he creates makes him even more difficult to hit. He has only worked 172 1/3 innings as a pro and his control and command still have a long way to go, but he has closer upside.

He signed for the largest bonus ($350,000) the Yankees gave to a pitcher in their 2020-21 international class, then opened eyes in his U.S. debut in 2023, when he was the best pitching prospect in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League. He looked great in two shutout innings against the Blue Jays during Spring Breakout last March, but shoulder issues restricted him to just 12 1/3 frames during the regular season. When healthy, Lalane demonstrates the potential for three plus pitches with possibly control to match. His fastball can sit at 93 mph and touch 97, though it could use more armside run and carry to keep it off barrels against more advanced hitters. He has advanced feel for a mid-80s changeup that fades and sinks, while he's still learning to harness a sweeping 78-82 mph slider. The 6-foot-7 Lalane inherited size and athleticism from his father, and he does a fine job of keeping his long limbs in sync to repeat this delivery and pound the strike zone. His big frame offers some natural extension, and his low release height provides extra deception. While he has a huge ceiling, he also worked just 123 2/3 innings -- and just six above Rookie ball -- in his first four years as a pro and will be Rule 5 Draft-eligible after this season.

It was a completely lost season. This is just the life of a pitching prospect, and it’s why rookie ball pitchers are some of my least favorite prospects to go after. There is just so much that can go wrong. But when you play the rookie ball pitcher game, you know what you are getting into, so the hope is that he can come back completely healthy in 2025 and immediately get the hype rolling again. Here was my blurb for him in the 2024 Top 1,000, and nothing has really changed assuming full health: “Rookie ball pitchers aren’t my favorite to go after, but if you are going to go after one, a 6’7”, 211 pound lefty with good stuff and good numbers isn’t a bad choice. Lalane put up a 36.6%/4.5% K%/BB% in 21.2 IP in stateside rookie ball with 3 potentially plus pitches (fastball, breaking ball, changeup). He only reached 4 IP in one outing, and the fastball sits in the low to mid 90’s, so there is a long way to go, but if you squint hard enough, you can see a CC Sabathia starter pack here. Here’s to hoping he can pack on 130 pounds of pure Captain Crunch to fulfill his destiny.” ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/165 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.36363636363636365,0.7272727272727273,0.48484848484848486,0.5757575757575758,52.69,33.333333333333336,0.0,81.81818181818181,21.696252465483234,4,1.0,28.199748968979737,44.118412139142904,0.47750000000000004,2–4 yr,-0.31666669999999897,53.80000039999999,71.9375,50.28502370174287,28.0625,0.49261249999999984,Mixed,43.56638574578429,sa3016066,playerId

He ranked second in the Minors in K/BB ratio (9.4) and third in walk rate (3 percent) among pitchers with 90 or more innings in 2024 before missing nearly four months of last season with a right calf strain. When Boston gambled by not placing him on its 40-man roster in November, the White Sox snagged him in the Rule 5 Draft at the Winter Meetings. While Paez still has below-average fastball velocity, his heater has moved from sitting at 85 mph in his pro debut to 88 in 2022 to 90 in 2023 and to 91 last year, peaking at 94. It works because of his precise command and ability to run four-seamers up in the zone or sink two-seamers at the knees. He used his solid low-80s slider more than his fastball in 2024, and it moves significantly in the opposite direction. His best pitch is his low-80s changeup, which fades and dives at the plate. Paez operates from a low three-quarters slot with a flat approach angle, adding life and deception to his offerings. He pounds the strike zone with all three of them and has uncanny feel for mixing pitches and locations. He's not very physical and his arm action may be better suited for relieving, but he could wind up as a back-of-the-rotation starter if he keeps proving himself.

He has a very fun, super athletic righty delivery and 2 potentially plus secondaries (slider, change). The fastball only sits low 90’s, but there is some projection there at a relatively thin 6’1”.

He’s moved slowly, starting in the Dominican Summer League in 2022 and heading to the Florida Complex League the following summer. His move to full-season ball didn’t go so well in 2023, but he had much better results with a return to Fort Myers last year, even though he was slowed early by a shoulder issue and then missed time with a hip impingement. A 6-foot-1 right-hander, Olivares could have four outstanding pitches if he keeps developing as he did in 2024. His fastball velocity increased from an average of 93 mph in 2023 to 95 mph this past year, touching 97 with really good riding life and armside run. He focused on developing more of a gyro slider with depth that also took a step forward, missing a ton of bats at around 87 mph. He folds in an 80 mph curve and has an interesting 86-87 mph changeup with movement that can miss bats too. Olivares did a better job last year of finding the strike zone, but he needs to improve his control and command, especially struggling with landing his curve and changeup in the zone. There could be more strikeouts to come if he can refine that and his overall pitch execution as he'll be 22 for all of the 2025 season.

Signed for $75,000 out of the Dominican Republic at age 18 in January 2021, he struck out 32 percent of the batters he faced in his first four pro seasons while climbing from Rookie ball to Triple-A. He led the Minors in opponents average (.163) while ranking third in strikeouts (171 in 130 1/3 innings) and sixth in K rate (31 percent) last year. Ullola's electric fastball can be unhittable, parking at 92-96 mph and peaking at 98 with a flat approach angle and tremendous carry up in the zone. He sharpened his mid-80s slider and threw more strikes with it in 2024, giving him a solid second offering. His low-80s curveball has more depth but isn't as devastating or reliable, while his upper-80s changeup has its moments but lacks consistent movement. Ullola has a quick arm and gets down the well, creating premium extension with a low-release height. He's athletic and his delivery isn't glaringly effortful, but he never has provided regular strikes and his 14 percent walk rate last year represented his career best. He has a special fastball and could become a mid-rotation starter if he can find more control, or perhaps will follow the Bryan Abreu path to Houston's bullpen if he can't.

He spent two seasons in the Dominican Summer League but has taken off in the past two seasons stateside. Arronde particularly flew onto the radar in 2024 pitching in Single-A Columbia, where he posted a 2.94 ERA across 110 1/3 innings with a 1.02 WHIP, a 23.5% strikeout rate and a 7.3% walk rate. With some strength now in his 6-foot-3 frame, Arronde’s velocity has steadily increased and sits 93-94 mph. But he can lose velocity late in the year as he struggles to keep weight on, thus leading to more hard contact on the pitch. What makes Arronde so interesting is his low-to-mid-80s split-finger changeup, a plus pitch that disappears under bats at the last second. He can land it for strikes, generate weak contact and get swing-and-miss on it. Arronde is also working on a low 80s slider that has a chance to be average or above. His clean delivery from a high three-quarters slot lends itself to throwing strikes. Arronde gets high marks for his tenacity and competitiveness on and off the mound. He’s still young with more strength needed and more development to go, but the split gives him an interesting profile as someone to keep an eye on. If his third pitch improves, he has potential as a back-end starter, but the splitter would certainly play in the bullpen.

He didn’t make a full-season debut until 2023 when he split the season between Single-A Lake Elsinore and High-A Fort Wayne, finishing with solid numbers (3.84 ERA, 99 strikeouts in 98 1/3 innings). He wasn’t added to the 40-man roster that offseason when Rule 5-eligible, however, because of his distance from the Majors. Baez enjoyed his big breakout last year, winning Padres Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors after posting a 2.99 ERA and a 1.09 WHIP with 109 strikeouts in 26 1/3 innings between Fort Wayne and Double-A San Antonio, and San Diego added him to the 40-man in November. His success continued with San Antonio in 2025 and he was leading the Texas League in ERA, WHIP and batting average against when he was included in the prospect package sent to the A’s in return for Mason Miller and JP Sears at the Trade Deadline. The 6-foot-3 right-hander has gained velocity steadily in his years as a pro and has touched as high as 99 mph this season. He typically sits around 94 mph, working north-south with the pitch while getting most of his whiffs up and to the armside. He played off that with a 76-79 mph curveball that could have more slurvish tendencies, but at its best, it snapped downward to fool batters sitting on the high heat and it had produced a 47 percent miss rate at the time of the trade. He also utilizes an 83-86 mph split-change to miss bats, but it stands out more for its separation than movement profile. Baez took a major jump in workload but didn’t let his control improvements suffer. That certainly helps his starting chances, as does his 50.1 percent ground-ball rate from 2024. He’s still only 22, but with his place on the roster now set, the A’s (never afraid to move guys quickly) could try to see what it looks like in the big leagues in a relief role to ease him in.

Pitching 84 innings for Single-A Dunedin in ‘23, Rojas posted a 3.75 ERA with 82 strikeouts and 32 walks. He followed that up with a 2.59 ERA in ‘24, topping out at High-A, that included 69 strikeouts in 62 2/3 innings. While a shoulder issue landed him on the IL early in 2024 and an abdominal strain delayed his '25 debut until the end of May this year, he managed to touch Triple-A for the first time, making a start the day before he was traded to the Twins in return for Louis Varland and Ty France at the Trade Deadline. Because of the injuries, we’re still yet to see what the 22-year-old left-hander looks like when he’s fully stretched out, given that his career high in innings is 84. All other signs are encouraging, though, with his fastball continuing to tick up this year, averaging 94-95 mph and touching 97 after hovering closer to 90 a couple of years ago. He’s also throwing his slider and changeup a bit harder, sitting 86-87 mph, with the former being his predominant secondary pitch. His challenge for now will be developing and maintaining a starter’s routine and carrying that top-end stuff past 100 innings. Rojas’ growth has been incremental over the years, but it’s all adding up now to one of the more intriguing left-handed pitching prospects in the Twins' system. From here, he needs to develop his routines and master everything that goes into pitching between his start days. He’s started to show that he can handle the challenge of the upper levels and if he can stay healthy, he could be ready to touch a big league rotation in 2026.

He climbed the ladder steadily with stops at Single-A and High-A in his first full season and returned to Fort Wayne for 2023, only to undergo Tommy John surgery that August after making only four starts. He missed all of 2024 while rehabbing and has been back in the Midwest League this season, now as a dominant late-inning reliever. Hawkins stands 6-foot-5 and throws out of an almost over-the-top delivery. It can look like he’s catapulting the ball toward home at times. Now that he’s pitching in shorter spurts, he leans even more on his 92-95 mph fastball. The pitch gets elite carry, and his large extension closes the decision window even more. He also mixes in a 79-81 mph sweeper for a chase pitch, and it can catch batters off guard. There’s a mid-70s curveball too and 82-85 mph changeup, but neither have found similar results to the other offerings. Hawkins’ move to the bullpen has as much to do with health and age (he turned 25 last offseason), than it does control. The fastball-heavy approach could make an absolute weapon against same-side bats, while lefties are likely to be more of a problem at the upper levels. Hawkins will be Rule 5-eligible this winter after going unprotected and unpicked last year, and his 40-man case should be much stronger this time around.

Following his brief pro debut, he blew out his elbow and had Tommy John surgery that October. He has displayed some of the best stuff in the system since returning in 2023, though he has struggled with his control and command. McDougal's fastball sits in the upper 90s and touches 100 mph, though it features more downhill plane than life and can get hit hard when he doesn’t locate it well. He generates high spin rates on two different breaking balls. His upper-70s downer curveball can make hitters look silly, but it has so much downer break that he rarely lands it in the zone, while his upper-80s slider is more reliable if less devastating. While McDougal's upper-80s changeup has some fade, he doesn't trust it or have much success with it. He lacks a polished delivery and doesn't repeat it well, which leads to below-average command of his fastball and control of his secondary pitches. His repertoire and lack of finesse may make him better suited for a relief role, though his mid-rotation starter ceiling will keep him in the rotation for a while.

After he performed well there and against older hitters in the inaugural season of the MLB Draft League, he signed for a well-over-slot $850,000 as a fifth-rounder. The youngest player (age 19) on Canada’s 2023 World Baseball Classic team, he reached Double-A shortly after turning 21 last summer. He returned to Frisco for 2025 and put up big strikeout numbers before being dealt to the D-backs at the Trade Deadline in the deal for Merrill Kelly. Bratt hasn’t added as much velocity as hoped since turning pro, but his low-90s fastball that tops out at 95 is still effective because it rides well up in the zone and he can command it where he wants. He plays off the heater with a low-80s slider with nice depth, a mid-80s cutter, an upper-70s curveball and a mid-80s changeup. The slide piece shows the most promise, and mixing in the cutter gives him a bridge pitch to work off that. Bratt’s athletic delivery features little effort and allows him to provide constant strikes. He can move his pitches around the zone and can read hitters’ swings to determine how to get them out. His craftiness and mound presence stand out more than his pure stuff, giving him a high floor as a back-of-the-rotation starter.

That hasn't really materialized, but he's learned how to use what he has to find success, and after spending two seasons with Single-A Modesto, he pitched his way from High-A to Double-A in 2024. Morales can bring as many as five pitches to the table, all coming from a simple and repeatable delivery that points to a future as an innings-eating starter; his 149 innings in 2024 landed him in the top 10 among all Minor League pitchers. It's not loud stuff, with a fastball that sat 92 mph, but he does command it well. His changeup might be the one pitch that has a chance to be an out pitch, thrown in the low 80s and missing bats at a 41 percent clip last year, according to Synergy. He has a whole array of breaking stuff, from a slower curve to a sweeper that can be effective, and he also has a cutter-like pitch that can have some gyro-like slider tendencies to it. Not only did Morales lower his walk rate considerably in 2024, his overall command within the zone improved as well, showing the ability to use the outer edges of the plate more effectively. His ceiling might be that of a durable workhorse in the back part of a rotation, but he will still be only 22 for most of the 2025 season.

The Tigers selected him in the 14th round that summer and signed him for $125,000, making him the first Charleston Southern player drafted in three years. Petit immediately moved into a relief role in the pros and has remained there since. He pitched well in Double-A in 2024 but was left unprotected and unpicked in that December's Rule 5 Draft. After a strong 2025 campaign that saw him reach Triple-A, Petit was once again left unprotected, but this time the Rockies made him the top pick of the Rule 5. Standing at 6-foot-8, Petit is a tremendous presence on the mound. He doesn’t get big extension out of that frame, instead using his height to create a steep downward plane leading to solid groundball rates. There is some velocity here, touching 98 mph while sitting 94-96, and he's worked to generate a bit more heat. Petit’s 83-85 mph gyro slider is much better at generating swing-and-miss and chase low in the zone with strong depth, and the Rockies think it's the kind of breaking ball that should play in Coors Field. He can tunnel his 86-89 mph changeup well enough off the fastball with just enough velocity separation for it to be effective. Petit has shown the ability to get righties and lefties out at the upper levels, and he was able to get his walk rate back down in 2025 to 3.0 per nine after seeing it creep up in 2024 (4.1 BB/9). He'll get his chance to stick with the Rockies, who see him as a potential bulk reliever.

His express train to the big leagues was derailed by an elbow injury and subsequent Tommy John surgery that kept him off a competitive mound for all of 2023 and 2024. His highly anticipated return to action in the Arizona Fall League last year did not disappoint, and there was little rust as the right-hander displayed his elite-level stuff over the course of six outings. During his time in the Fall League, Painter showed that in many ways he was the same premium prospect with a legitimate four-pitch mix, albeit with a little twist. His plus heater was touching 100 mph again and averaged 97 in the fall with plenty of ride up in the zone, he dropped in his low-80s curve for strikes and his above-average changeup got better as the fall season wore on. The new wrinkle for the 6-foot-7 right-hander was a harder slider with cutter-like action thrown in the upper 80s, replacing what had been more of a sweeper. Painter misses bats with all four offerings, and while his fastball command was understandably a bit scattered at times given his long layoff, he continued to astound with his ability to pound the strike zone thanks to a simple and repeatable delivery. Even with all the time away, Painter will be just 22 years old for the 2025 season and ready to pick up where he left off before the injury.

Just seeing that he was able to ramp up and start pitching in games without getting re-injured is a big first step that we can cross off our worry list this off-season. But he’s also proving he is nearly 100% healthy with the plus to double plus fastball sitting mid to upper 90’s. Like we saw with Shane Baz, it seems that breaking ball crispness and consistency can be something that lags behind after Tommy John, but long term the slider projects as plus and he also throws a lesser used curve and change that could end up plus pitches in their own right. If you ignore the injury, he’s basically a perfect pitching prospect with size, athleticism, velocity, double plus fastball, plus secondary, diverse pitch mix, and plus control. And now that we’ve seen him back on the mound and thriving, the injury risk is a bit lessened. He moves back into my top spot among pitching prospects after his AFL performance, but it’s still a tight race with Noah Schultz, who I absolutely love. It was announced the Phillies plan to slow play him in 2025, which his ETA in the majors around July, and if that helps keep him healthy, avoiding the end of season dilemma for a contending team where he’s at his innings limit, I’m all for it. – 2025 Projection: 6/3.68/1.20/86 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 15/2.95/0.91/225 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5714285714285714,0.4789915966386555,0.7394957983193278,0.5714285714285714,58.31,100.0,100.0,96.875,98.22485207100591,4,1.0,98.90994822485206,72.51998187869822,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.7111112000000013,94.53333440000002,85.0,68.00649472360948,15.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,64.25958950562426,sa3017880,playerId

He posted a 3.05 ERA at High-A last year with the best average-against (.181) and second-highest strikeout percentage (30 percent) among Midwest League pitchers with at least 90 innings, but he also had the worst walk percentage (17 percent). Heubeck now operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that reaches 97 with huge induced vertical break that creates significant carry. Both his upper-70s downer curveball and his tighter mid-80s slider can be plus pitches that work against both lefties and righties when he lands them for strikes, which he hasn't done consistently in pro ball. He also has a mid-80s changeup with fade and sink that could be an average pitch if he learns to harness it. Heubeck has a clean arm action and an athletic delivery that should be conducive to at least average control. He sometimes overspins his breaking balls and needs to find a better balance between trying to create nasty stuff and throwing strikes. The Dodgers still think he could develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter, even if takes longer than they expected.

Signed for a well-over-slot $1.5 million, he spent his first two years as a pro in Rookie ball before pitching well at two Class A levels in 2023. He starred at another new event in 2024, pitching four shutout innings with eight strikeouts against the Blue Jays in a Spring Breakout game, but rarely looked that sharp at Double-A before his season ended in July with biceps inflammation. The Yankees had Selvidge lean heavily on his best pitch last season, when he threw his sweeping low-80s slider nearly half the time, and he'll also mix in an upper-80s cutter as well. That usage and his biceps injury may have contributed to the loss of a tick or two of fastball velocity, as he operated at 91-94 and peaked at 96, and his heater straightens out and gets hit when he doesn't locate it up in the zone. His mid-80s changeup has impressive fade but won't be a reliable option until he can land it for strikes consistently. While Selvidge's walk rate jumped from 7 percent in his first three pro seasons to 11 percent in 2024, he has the athleticism and clean delivery to have at least average control and command. He earns praise for his mound presence and has a higher floor than most of New York's starting pitching prospects. He's a good bet to become a No. 4 or 5 starter, and his slider alone would make him a useful lefty reliever.

Signed for an over-slot $900,000 as a third-rounder, he blew out his elbow the following February and required Tommy John surgery that sidelined him until mid-2023. He showcases an interesting arsenal but couldn't harness it last season in High-A, where he limited opponents to a .196 average and logged a 27.6 percent strikeout rate -- but also a 20.8 percent walk rate. While Gray's stuff was down about two mph across the board last year, he still missed bats when he was near the plate. Batters couldn't solve his fastball while it parked at 90-93 mph and topped out at 96 because it features quality carry and the extension in his delivery provides plenty of deception. The sweeping action on his upper-70s slider and mid-70s curveball made them difficult to barrel, though his fading low-80s changeup remains a work in progress. Gray also drew scouting interest as an outfielder in high school, is one of the best athletes in the system and throws without much effort. Yet he struggles to keep all the moving parts of his delivery in sync and when he misses the strike zone, he often does so by such a large margin that hitters aren't tempted to chase. He has the ingredients for mid-rotation starter ceiling, but will be ticketed for the bullpen if he can't improve his control.

His development since has been slow and inconsistent, and he returned for a full season at High-A in 2024 after struggling there at the end of ‘23. Last year, Mozzicato posted a 3.45 ERA across 101 2/3 innings, limiting batters to a .203 average. But he walked 62 batters while his strikeout rate fell to 21.3%. Mozzicato’s best pitch remains his plus low-80s curveball with downer movement. He’s always been able to spin the ball well, but the command was not consistent in 2024. It doesn’t help that his fastball velocity continues to fluctuate as Mozzicato struggles to keep weight and strength on during the season. His heater was 87-90 mph and was out of the zone too often in '24, but it does have some high vert with a good approach angle. He has increased the usage of an average circle changeup, but it doesn’t have a ton of velo separation from his fastball. If the heater is performing well one night, so is his changeup, and vice versa. Mozzicato’s numbers weren’t bad in 2024, but the Royals worked with him a lot on some under-the-surface aspects after the season so he can be better set up for success at the higher level. The priority was reworking his long arm action that really hindered not only his command but also his velocity, officials believed. Specific drills helped him shorten up the arm stroke, and he was having better results by Spring Training. But Mozzicato will have to show it in games and see if his control issues can be ironed out because that and the low velocity will hold him back from starter projection. They looked better at High-A Quad Cities to open 2025 but regressed again after a promotion to Double-A.

High School, Kudrna won Kansas baseball Gatorade Player of the Year honors as a senior as his Draft stock climbed. He was a Louisiana State commit but decided to go pro when the Royals selected him No. 43 overall in the 2021 Draft and gave him an over-slot $3 million. He’s had a steady climb in the Minor Leagues, reaching Double-A in 2024, his third full season of pro ball. Kudrna threw 115 1/3 innings between two levels last year, with a 3.49 ERA at High-A (14 starts) before the jump to Double-A, where he got hit around a bit more and posted a 5.32 ERA in nine appearances (eight starts). Kudrna throws from a three-quarters arm slot and has always had solid strikeout and walk rates. His four-seam fastball sits at 92-95 mph, a few ticks down from his peak prep velocity, but he can flash in the upper 90s at times. He’s bigger and stronger than he was in high school, but there still might be a bit more in the tank. The pitch was more vulnerable to slug at Double-A in ‘24, likely a result of command. Kudrna’s best secondary pitch is his changeup, a plus to double-plus pitch that plays well off his fastball. He also features a mid-80s gyro slider with late bite, and consistency with the pitch was his biggest offseason focus. Kudrna introduced a two-seam fastball into his repertoire in 2024, a pitch that has the same velocity as his four-seam but with more run -- and something he’s very comfortable throwing. Kudrna’s delivery is good overall, although the Royals targeted his hip-shoulder separation as needing to be more consistent, and he focused on that this past offseason too. His physical frame makes him a durable and reliable rotation arm, projecting as a back-end starter, although his velocity might tick up more if he’s in the bullpen. He needs to adjust a little more to a higher level, so he’ll head back to Double-A this year with a chance for a Triple-A promotion later in the season depending on performance.

When Solometo reached Double-A at age 20 in 2023, it seemed like he was on a faster track to Pittsburgh. He got derailed back in Double-A in 2024 when his velocity dropped considerably, landing on the development list to work on getting his stuff back, then missed nearly all of the 2025 season because of shoulder issues. For Solometo to have success, he’ll need to get back to his fastball sitting in the low 90s instead of topping out at 90 mph like it was for much of 2024. With a funky delivery and sink, the pitch can play up when the velocity increases, and while there were encouraging signs in pitching camp and in early live BP sessions in Spring Training, pitching in the 92-94 mph range, his shoulder problem kept him from building off of that. Everything else plays off of that, with his mid-80s slider missing more bats and his 84-85 mph changeup that kills spin being more effective with more velocity separation from his heater. There are a lot of moving parts to Solometo’s delivery, much of which works to his advantage in terms of deception but can make it a little more difficult for him to be on time and throw strikes consistently. The silver lining from 2024 might be that Solometo had to try to compete with a below-average fastball and learned to induce weak contact more, with the hopes that the regained velocity could come back and stick when he’s healthy.

He wasn’t able to make his pro debut until 2022 because of arm issues, but in his three seasons, going from the Arizona Complex League to Single-A Inland Empire in 2023 and up to High-A Tri-City in 2024, he’s been lighting up radar guns but struggling to find success in other facets of the mound game. While he’s just six-feet tall, Urena shows off an upper-90s fastball that touches triple digits. There was some hope that switching to a two-seamer with sink would help his overall command, but that hasn’t been the case, though he does get a good amount of groundball outs. His changeup is still his second-best pitch, flashing above average with good fade and some bat-missing ability, and his breaking ball is now more of a hard power curve thrown with slider velocity, in the 83-86 mph range. In the second half of the 2023 season, Urena cut his walk rate down, leading some to hope that the two-seamer switch was working. He was back up to walking 6.3 per nine, though he had a couple of better outings in July before he was shut down following a comebacker off of his foot. He needs to find a true out pitch, and most feel he’ll end up in a bullpen eventually, but the Angels don’t want to limit the 21-year old’s innings just yet.

San Diego sent him stateside for eight appearances in the Arizona Complex League to begin his age-18 season when he was dealt to the Nationals as part of the Juan Soto blockbuster. Susana saw time with Single-A Fredericksburg after the trade, returned there for all of 2023 and then opened 2024 back in the Carolina League. He had an 8.89 ERA with 19 walks in 26 1/3 innings through his first three starts of last season but quickly course-corrected with a 2.79 ERA, 123 strikeouts and 29 walks in 77 1/3 innings over his final 18 starts, 10 of which came with High-A Wilmington. The 6-foot-6 righty makes velocity look easy with a four-seam and a two-seam fastball that typically sit in the 98-101 mph range. He was still touching as high as 102 at times into last September. His gyro slider plays really well off the fastball with good, late vertical drop to elude bats, and he can backfoot lefties as well as yank away from righties. His low-90s changeup is a distant third pitch, which enabled opposite-side batters to post better splits (.751 OPS vs. .516). Starting primarily from the stretch, it doesn’t look like Susana is overthrowing to get the heat, though his zealous follow-through adds flair. He focused a ton on developing a repeatable delivery in between outings in 2024, and the improvements in that regard allowed his control rates to improve drastically as the season wore on, though they've regressed again in 2025. There will always be talk of a future as a closer, but Susana is looking more than ever like a potential impact MLB starter.

After a rough start, he caught fire, putting up a 2.79 ERA with a 39.4/9.3 K%/BB% in his final 77.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. The Greene comp is actually extremely on point for the similarly sized, 6’6”, 235 pound Susana with an upper 90’s fastball that doesn’t get enough movement, a double plus slider, below average control, and a developing splitter. The improvements that Greene made this season (turning the splitter into a legit third weapon and improving his fastball movement) are the same improvements Susana has to make as he continues to climb the ladder. He also needs to continue to improve his control/command, as he can start to look a big relievery at times. There is still plenty of risk here, but there is legit top of the rotation upside, and he could have a soft landing spot as an elite closer. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.55/1.26/187 in 165 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9333333333333333,0.9916666666666667,0.23333333333333328,0.925,79.26,50.0,0.0,95.55555555555556,85.99605522682445,4,1.0,56.93195266272189,71.44518343195267,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.6638889,81.9666668,85.0,77.32155504958581,15.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,65.93803313231362,sa3018808,playerId

While he’s never been the prospect to wow evaluators with velocities and pitch movement metrics, Perez has tremendous feel for his pitches, creating a prospect who is greater than the sum of his individual tools. Perez broke out in 2023, posting a 2.72 ERA over 49 2/3 innings in the Complex League, and he followed that up with a 4.06 ERA and 86 strikeouts over 82 innings at Single-A. Perez’s profile is all about his potential floor, which right now points toward him being a back-end depth starter in the big leagues. For his ceiling to move, some of his stuff will need to tick up once more, which starts with his fastball. Perez sat 93-94 mph last season, which was an encouraging step, while showing a good feel for his 82-85 mph slider. Perez tends to live in the zone (2.0 BB/9 career), which is his greatest strength but also something that will present a challenge. As he faces more advanced hitters who know they’ll be getting pitches near the plate, can Perez adjust and miss bats? The slider will be a key piece there, as will developing a consistent changeup. Most pitchers Perez’s age have high-end stuff, but need more feel. Perez is the opposite, which makes him so unique on this list, but he needs to show he can keep living in the zone at each stop up the ladder. High-A batters began to make a ton of contact against him in 2025 until he showed signs of a breakout in July.

He’s been a project on the bump ever since, even walking 20.2 percent of his batters faced in 2024 -- his first stateside campaign. But that project was rounding into terrific form in the Florida State League this summer as Aracena flipped between starting and relieving and racking up innings in his age-20 season when he was sent to the Orioles as part of the return for Gregory Soto near the Trade Deadline. Standing at 6-foot-3, the right-hander has built up velocity as he’s physically matured, and he now brings serious heat to the mound, sitting 96-99 mph with his four-seam fastball and topping out at 101 in ’25. The movement profile doesn’t quite pop, but while the heater has been more touchable than the velo would indicate, it’s still generally weak contact. The star of the show is arguably Aracena’s razor-sharp 92-94 mph cutter. It comes with plenty of heat itself but moves six more inches to the gloveside than the four-seamer and comes with some drop, often leading batters befuddled. He has the makings of an upper-80s slider with good depth too, giving him another whiff-heavy option, and a mid-80s curveball that isn’t at the same level. Aracena has barely thrown his 92-95 mph changeup in ’25 because it doesn’t offer much of a change of speeds. Entering late July, Aracena had cut his walk rate down to 13.2 percent with Single-A St. Lucie, but he still has the makings of a pitcher trying to blow his stuff past batters. Even if he has to stick in relief, the fastball/cutter combination could be stellar in the back of an MLB bullpen.

In between, he’s been a steady performer in the Arizona system. His 2024 campaign was put on pause when he suffered facial fractures on a foul ball hit to the Double-A Amarillo dugout, but he still managed a 4.28 ERA with 90 strikeouts in 94 2/3 innings in the Texas League before making one start for Triple-A Reno. Lin rounded out his stateside season with three Arizona Fall League starts before heading abroad for Premier12. The 5-foot-11 southpaw steps to the side and rocks a bit to begin his delivery out of the stretch with a little flair. He throws both a four-seamer and a sinker in the 90-92 mph range (occasionally touching 95-96). Without stellar velocity, he needs the different movement profiles to keep hitters off balance. He also has to locate the pitches well, because when he doesn’t, they can be crushed. But the depth of the arsenal reveals more promising offerings, like an 80-82 mph changeup that fades well off the heat and a mid-70s curveball. Both are options against righties, while a 79-82 mph sweeper is his go-to secondary against lefties. Both breaking balls play with extreme spin with the curve, in particular, averaging above 3,000 rpm at Triple-A Reno in 2025. Lin has also worked on incorporating an upper-80s cutter to keep hitters guessing further. He needs to live on the edges of the zone if he’s going to achieve whiffs because he can’t blow pitches by batters. His four-seamer has been particularly crushed in the Pacific Coast League. Lin’s outing against Japan showed he doesn’t back down from challenges, though, and he has enough offerings to make it work as a starter.

Though he’s still a little raw and unpolished, teams tend to salivate over left-handers with De León's profile. He’s a long, lean, athletic 6-foot-3 with a legitimate three-pitch mix that is very difficult for hitters to square up when he’s commanding it well. The heavy-sinking fastball he slings generates tons of weak grounders and he can reach back and touch the upper 90s with it at times. His secondary offerings are a sharp slider with three-quarter break and a fading changeup. Both have a chance to be average pitches because De León throws everything with good arm speed and angle when his mechanics are clicking. When they aren’t, below-average control and inconsistent command undercut his effectiveness and things can spiral. The walk issues stem from De León’s need to find a consistent release point and better repeat his delivery, which should help him stay ahead of hitters, pitch in fewer defensive counts and limit damage. There is still time for him to do that, given that he'll be 22 for all of the 2025 season. If he can improve at throwing all three of his pitches for strikes, he has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter, though his stuff is probably good enough to impact a bullpen sooner if something clicks mechanically.

His secondary offerings are a sharp slider with three-quarter break and a fading changeup. Both have a chance to be average pitches because De León throws everything with good arm speed and angle when his mechanics are clicking. When they aren’t, below-average control and inconsistent command undercut his effectiveness and things can spiral. The walk issues stem from De León’s need to find a consistent release point and better repeat his delivery, which should help him stay ahead of hitters, pitch in fewer defensive counts and limit damage. There is still time for him to do that, given that he'll be 22 for all of the 2025 season. If he can improve at throwing all three of his pitches for strikes, he has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter, though his stuff is probably good enough to impact a bullpen sooner if something clicks mechanically.

They were able to add Lara’s talent to the system for just $10,000 in June. He was 18 when he signed, a bit older for the market, but he’s moved relatively quickly since, coming to the United States for the first time in 2023 and reaching Double-A in 2024. Lara will be 22 for all of the 2025 season and remains primarily a two-pitch pitcher. His fastball backed up a little bit in 2024, averaging more around 94-95 mph and topping out at 96-97. His upper-80s slider with good spin and sweep was excellent, with a 46 percent miss rate on the pitch last year, and he threw it almost as often as his heater. There’s talk of him playing around with a changeup at some point, but the focus remains on the consistency of his two potentially plus offerings. What kind of role Lara might have long-term will come down to his ability to repeat his delivery and throw strikes. There’s definitely reliever risk here given that he walked 6.5 per nine last year (5.9/9 in his career), but the Braves don’t want to pull the plug too quickly on him starting because his stuff holds up and misses bats consistently.

After one season in the Dominican Summer League, he’s been on a fast track toward San Diego, having played for all five stateside affiliates between 2023 and ’24. In his most recent campaign, he finished with a 2.43 ERA and 64 strikeouts over 63 innings across the top three levels of the Minors. Like many Padres pitching prospects, his numbers jumped at hitter-friendly El Paso but not enough to be overly concerning. Pena cuts a thin figure at 6-foot-1, setting up out of the stretch from the first-base side of the rubber. But he generated over 7 feet of extension at Triple-A, putting himself close to the plate with dynamic stuff. He throws a pair of fastballs, both in the 94-97 mph range -- a sinker with more than 11 inches of armside run and a straighter four-seamer. He leaned on the former more at Triple-A, which makes sense given his other offering. In 2025, his most oft-used secondary is an 86-89 mph two-plane slider that he uses to get a ton of whiffs. Walks weren't a huge issue for Pena in the Minors until his extended time at Triple-A in '25. The sinker helps him run a heavy ground-ball rate. The lack of a changeup may make him a questionable fit against lefties at the top level, but the slider has served him well enough so far. He has to find more strikes if he's going to earn that MLB debut.

They landed Suarez in a familiar way, picking him up in a relatively low-profile trade while he was pitching in the complex leagues. That strategy once brought them Curtis Mead and, more famously, Junior Caminero. In November 2022, they played that card again to get Suarez and starter Marcus Johnson from the Marlins for reliever JT Chargois and infielder Xavier Edwards. The native of Cumana, Venezuela, was arguably the steadiest and most reliable arm in that season-ending Charleston rotation, but that’s not a knock on his stuff. His fastball sat in the mid-90s last season and touched 97 mph. His low-80s curveball is arguably the best hook in Tampa Bay’s system. He also throws a changeup that rounds out his arsenal. But his carrying trait, the thing that makes it all work for Suarez, is his control. With a repeatable delivery and a cool, collected mound presence, he consistently fills up the strike zone and has walked only 1.6 batters per nine innings in the Minors at an age when many starters are struggling to consistently put the ball where they want it. Suarez’s tendency to throw strikes has also helped him induce chases outside the strike zone and enough swing-and-miss to succeed. Bottom line, Suarez has performed well wherever he’s gone, from his time as a statistical standout in the Dominican Summer League at age 17 to his 23-start campaign in Single-A last year. He doesn’t have a ton of physical projection left, unlike his rotation mates, but he might have the highest floor and the highest likelihood to make it as a starter, although triceps/shoulder issues have limited him in 2025.

He led the Rookie-level Florida Complex League with 63 strikeouts in 41 2/3 innings during his U.S. debut in 2023 but missed most of last season with back inflammation. He worked just 29 2/3 innings between Rookie ball, Single-A and the Arizona Fall League, hitting triple digits with his heater but also issuing 35 walks before finding the strike zone much more regularly in 2025. Lagrange sits at 97-99 mph and reaches 102 with his fastball, and he's showing more consistent carry, armside run and command with his heater now that he's fully healthy. His sweeping 82-85 mph slider can be a well-above-average offering at its best and he's doing a better job of landing it for strikes this year. He also can turn his slider into an upper-80s cutter and has upgraded his feel for an upper-80s changeup with some fade and depth. The 6-foot-7 Lagrange doesn't create much extension in his delivery but does work from a low three-quarters slot that provides a flat approach angle. He'll never have pinpoint control but he has improved his ability to locate his arsenal this year. He has the stuff to be a frontline starter or closer and is creating much more optimism that he'll be able to reach his lofty ceiling.

He was older, already 21 when he signed, so after getting started in the Dominican Summer League after signing, he went straight to full-season ball in 2023, starting very slowly but then figuring things out in the back end of the season. After starting and relieving with Single-A Inland Empire, he was a mainstay in High-A Tri-City’s rotation in 2024 with mixed results, though he did lead the Northwest League in innings pitched (138 2/3) and strikeouts (134). Now 24, it feels like in many ways Hurtado is still figuring out who he is as a pitcher. The 6-foot-2 right-hander can light up the radar gun, flirting with triple digits and sitting in the mid-90s with ease, throwing two-seamers with sink to get groundball outs. His slider, which he can run up into the upper-80s, has become his breaking ball – he’s all but scrapped a slower get-me-over curve – and he misses a lot of bats with it. He continues to try to find a third pitch, some kind of change-of-speed, that can work for him. Hurtado’s ability to land his two potentially plus pitches for strikes regressed in 2024 and he walked 5.3 per nine as a result. The Angels may not want to pull the plug on him starting just yet so he can work on his command and that third offering, but it’s hard not to dream about him as a sinker-slider reliever who’s throwing 100 mph-plus in shorter stints.

Focusing on pitching only for the first time, he had a pretty solid first full season of pro ball, ending the year with High-A Rome. He went back to the level to kick off 2024 and was throwing very well until he was shut down with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery at the start of June. Before the injury, Murphy’s stuff was all trending up, coming from his strong, athletic 6-foot-1 frame. His velocity had climbed back up to the low 90s, and he was throwing it with plenty of ride and high spin up in the zone. His mid-80s slider had cutting action to it and could miss bats and his slower mid-70s curve provided a different look. There had been some feel for a changeup in the past as well. A solid athlete on the mound, there’s confidence Murphy will be a solid strike-thrower in the future, with a repeatable delivery. Because of the timing of the elbow surgery, it’s likely going to be the 2026 season that he’ll be going full-tilt again, and he’ll still be just 22 years old.

That likely keeps him out for most or all of 2025, but it does give him enough of a cushion to prove he’s healthy by the end of the season and possibly into the AFL, so there could be some budding hype by this time next year assuming full health. And if he hadn’t gotten hurt, the hype could have been hitting hard already with a 1.54 ERA and 38.7/7.7 K%/BB% in 41 IP at High-A. The fastball only sits low 90’s, but it gets a ton of movement and is a plus pitch. The slider and curveball both still need refinement, but the slider in particular will flash at least plus. And the control/command is potentially plus with an extremely easy and athletic righty delivery. He’s not necessarily that in your face, upper 90’s, mountain of a man pitching prospect (6’1”) that will get no doubt elite pitching prospect love, but he’s the one who will sneak up on you real fast until he’s all of a sudden doing it against MLB hitters. The injury obviously complicates things, but I like him enough to not have it kill his value.

CC product signed with the Padres for $10,000 in August 2022. Shoulder issues limited his first full season to 40 1/3 innings between the Arizona Complex League and Single-A Lake Elsinore, but he confirmed his spot on the radar with 21 strikeouts in 17 1/3 frames in the Arizona Fall League. Nett, who dealt with elbow tightness in the summer, expanded his workload slightly to 65 innings in '24 and made 19 of his 20 appearances with High-A Fort Wayne before a cup of Double-A coffee. He made up for the lost innings with a stellar turn (1.02 ERA, 23 strikeouts in five starts) in the Puerto Rican Winter League. He had already surpassed his career high in innings pitched in his first full season in the Texas League when he was part of the four-prospect package sent to the A’s in return for Mason Miller and JP Sears at the Trade Deadline. While working around the injuries, Nett has continued to show stellar velocity, touching as high as 99 mph in the Minor Leagues last season. He typically sits 95-97 mph and gets swing-and-miss up in the zone thanks to ample carry. He also throws a tight 81-84 mph slider that ran a 38 percent whiff rate in ’24 and a sharper 90-92 mph cutter that can catch hitters off guard. He’ll mix in an upper-70s curveball with more vertical drop and he’s scrapped a low-80s splitter in favor of a much more effective 88 mph kick-change that really neutralizes lefties. Nett has some effort in his delivery, and the 2025 season (pre-trade) was the first time he’d posted a walk rate below 13 percent at any Minor League stop. Combine that with the early injury concerns, and it’s easy to think he could be a reliever eventually. But his arsenal is deep enough, and his stuff is promising enough -- when combined with strides taken this season -- to keep landing him in a starting role in the upper Minors.

The Braves took him with a compensation pick after Round 2 of that summer’s Draft, but he needed Tommy John surgery shortly after he had begun his first pro season. He had a solid return to the mound with High-A Rome in 2024, logging 72 total innings for the year. Though he’s just 6-foot and has that impressive relief resume in college, the Braves are continuing to give Burkhalter the chance to start. That’s because he now has a viable four-pitch mix and the ability to land all of them in the strike zone. His velocity was back upon his return, up to 98 mph with a fastball that features good carry. A cutter that he can get up to about 91-92 mph is hard and short, and he throws it all hitters. At one point he shelved his slider, but he brought it back with better results command-wise, and it’s more of a gyro-type pitch with more depth than the cutter. He has a changeup but doesn’t throw it as much. Burkhalter was able to show that the improvements he made control-wise in college have stuck, which was even more impressive considering it was his first year back from elbow surgery. The gloves should come off more now, and while he may still end up back in a bullpen one day, the Braves are excited to see what he can do taking the ball in a rotation.

Ritchie, taken in the Competitive Balance Round A and signed for just over slot, was sandwiched between Owen Murphy in the first round and Cole Phillips in the second. All three have had elbow problems: Phillips, now with the Mariners, has had two Tommy John surgeries; Murphy had TJ last June and Ritchie is putting his May 2023 surgery in the rearview, having returned to the mound for 49 2/3 innings in 2024. After passing the test of taking the ball regularly and throwing strikes during his return, Ritchie’s velocity and crispness started coming back in 2025. The heater was back to averaging close to 94 mph, according to Synergy, and topping out at 97 mph while missing a decent amount of bats. The sharpness in his low-80s slider, which could get back to being a true out pitch with bite, has also started to reemerge. His changeup was very effective upon his return, and he sells the low-80s offering well with excellent arm speed. Ritchie’s athleticism on the mound helped him repeat his delivery and allowed him to find the strike zone pretty consistently right out of the gate. The gloves can come off a bit in 2025, with the Braves getting their first real look at the Pacific Northwesterner who still has a mid-rotation ceiling.

Ritchie looked like he could have been headed for a breakout in 2023 before undergoing the surgery in late May, and he not only was able to return before the end of 2024, but he shined. He put up a 2.90 ERA with a 27.3/8.3 K%/BB% in 49.2 IP between 3 levels (rookie, A, A+). He looks the part at 6’2”, 185 pounds with a low to mid 90’s fastball, starter’s pitch mix, and potentially above average or better control/command. Both the slider and changeup are legit weapons, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out, and the fastball certainly has the ability to tick up into the mid 90’s considering it was closer to the mid 90’s before the injury. With a normal off-season, there is a chance he could look even stronger across the board in 2025, making him a very reasonably priced breakout option.

Injuries kept Prosecky off the mound for most of 2021, and he then served as the Cardinals’ closer in 2022, leading to the Rockies taking him in the sixth round and giving him the chance to start he was hoping to get in college. It looked like a good move after his first full season (2.72 ERA, 10.3 K/9) with Single-A Fresno, but elbow issues limited him to just 48 1/3 IP during the regular season. He did make up for some lost time in the Arizona Fall League. The 6-foot-3 left-hander does have the size and repertoire to potentially start, with a four-pitch mix. At his best, he runs his fastball up to 95-96 mph and can command it well, missing bats with it along the way. He has a slider that has late action with depth, a slower curve that he can use to steal a strike and an improving feel for his changeup as well. Prosecky had thrown just 64 innings in college before topping 100 IP in 2023. The Rockies are hopeful that a now completely healthy Prosecky, who has generally been around the zone when he’s at his best, can hit the reset switch and start moving up the ladder again in 2025.

The Twins got him on Day 3, in the 13th round, part of a Draft class that has produced big leaguer Zebby Matthews as well as fellow pitching prospects Connor Prielipp, Andrew Morris and Cory Lewis. Culpper had a solid, but unspectacular first full season in 2023, then pitched his way from High-A to Double-A with better stuff in 2024, though he missed two months with a forearm strain and a pinched nerve in his right wrist delayed his 2025 debut until the end of May. With a bit of a kitchen sink repertoire, Culpepper can offer many different looks to get hitters out, even if he lacks any purely plus stuff. His fastball averaged around 94 mph last year and topped out at 98 mph, and he can throw his four-seamer up in the zone, then sink a two-seamer to get groundball outs. A key part in developing that part of his arsenal will be to maintain velocity deeper into outings. His low-80s sweeping slider can miss a lot of bats, and he's worked to improve his 89-90 mph cutter; blending the latter pitch with his four-seamer more will help him at the upper levels. Culpepper's walk rate can get elevated against left-handed hitters at times, and being able to land his changeup in the zone against them more should help while giving them a softer look away. There might be more to unlock as Culpepper tweaks some things with his delivery in terms of his lower half load and being more aggressively downhill as he comes off the mound. A few more consistent ticks of velocity could help cement him in a big league rotation.

So even after three years with the Mavericks and then one as Texas Tech's Friday night starter, he was still only 20 when the Twins popped him in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft. He pitched well in his first full season of pro ball but took a bigger step forward in 2024, going from High-A to Triple-A, piling up 133 innings and topping the organization in pitching categories like K/BB (4.16), BAA (.219) and WHIP (1.08). The six-foot Morris has a full arsenal and a firm idea of how to use it. While his fastball averaged only around 94 mph, he could reach up to 97 mph at times. He's working on a sinker he can use against right-handed hitters to help open up the outside part of the plate for his secondary offerings, namely his upper-80s slider and newer cutter, which he throws around 90 mph. Added depth to his slider and strides with that cutter are a big reason why he missed more bats as he moved up the ladder, though he'll need to work to keep those as distinct pitches, and better location of the slider could lead to more chase. He still has a mid-70s curveball he can fold in and a too-firm changeup. Morris has outstanding command, which the Twins put in control-master Zebby Matthews territory. There's hope Morris can add a little more consistent velocity -- he threw a bit harder at the end of 2023 compared to last year, partially because of some lower back issues -- which should allow him to keep missing more bats as he prepares to be yet another mid-round Twins draftee to hit the big league rotation.

He came up big in the postseason, striking out 10 while beating Kansas in the Big 12 Conference tournament, defeating Florida in the NCAA regionals and whiffing 12 in a College World Series victory over Texas A&M as the Sooners finished second in Omaha. Signed for an over-slot $397,500 as a Royals 11th-round pick in 2022 and traded to the Red Sox for John Schreiber in February 2022, he struck out 33 percent of the batters he faced in his first two full pro seasons but also missed time with oblique and forearm strains. Sandlin can make hitters look bad with three different pitches, starting with a fastball that parks at 94-97 mph and peaks at 100, albeit with inconsistent armside run and carry. He switched to more of a sweeping slider in 2024, operating in the mid-80s with good shape, and he can turn it into a tighter upper-80s cutter. He also achieves nice depth on his upper-80s splitter, which can be unhittable at its best. A bit of an enigma, Sandlin has some effort and red flags in his delivery yet repeats it well and fills the strike zone. And despite his quality stuff and control, he got roughed up for a 5.34 ERA and .269/.324/.511 batting line last year. He has the upside to pitch in the front half of a rotation but also comes with reliever risk and will wind up in the bullpen if he can't improve his command and durability.

He has high octane stuff with a mid to upper 90’s fastball, two variations of a slider that miss bats, and a developing changeup/splitter. He pitched in mostly short outings in 2024, and he’s yet to pitch in more than 66.2 IP over the course of a season in pro ball. He’s already 24 years old, so it’s on the old side to be so far from being fully ramped up. It makes me think that Boston views him more as a bullpen weapon on their ascending team. There is upside, and he for sure could work his way into the rotation at some point, but I’m kinda leaning bullpen arm, at least for the first few years of his career. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.32/48 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.85/1.26/148 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7142857142857143,0.42857142857142855,0.773109243697479,0.5882352941176471,62.7,69.56521739130434,47.05882352941176,,43.39250493096647,3,0.75,48.25603874625411,57.64461356118894,1.0,0–1 yr,-1.5749999999999993,68.89999999999999,70.0,62.11338406835669,20.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,52.73102283076051,sa3020606,playerId

Playing alongside Cam Collier at Chipola that year certainly helped. The Reds took Collier in the first round, then nabbed Huggins in the fourth. It’s been uphill sledding for the right-hander, with Tommy John surgery in June 2023 keeping out until the very end of the '24 season. He started to figure things out in 2025, the third season he spent with Single-A Daytona, though he earned a promotion to High-A Dayton in late July, just ahead of him being sent to the A’s in the Miguel Andujar Trade Deadline deal. A strong and athletic 6-foot-3 right-hander, Huggins has the chance to have a solid three-pitch mix. He’s always had a power arm and his fastball now averages better than 94 mph, touching 97. He backs up the heater with a hard slider he throws in the 86-91 mph range, and has decent feel for an 87-91 mph changeup, producing a 33 percent miss rate combined with Daytona in 2025. While command was an issue for Huggins at Chipola and at the outset of his Reds career, he’s been throwing more consistent strikes with the surgery fully behind him. How much he can develop his secondaries will likely determine what his ultimate role is.

The Dodgers acquired him as part of a three-team trade this July that sent catcher Hunter Feduccia to the Rays. Serwinowski keeps adding velocity as he packs more strength onto his 6-foot-5 frame, and he's now sitting at 93-96 mph and touching 101 with plenty of spin and carry on his fastball. He backs up his heater with a low-80s slider with high spin rates and sweeping action. He's developing an upper-80s changeup with fade that shows the potential to become an average pitch. As if his fastball/slider combination wasn't tough enough to deal with, Serwinowski also provides plenty of deception with an extremely short arm action and natural extension in his delivery. His control and command are works in progress but are showing improvement. He has No. 3 starter upside and Los Angeles can afford to be patient with his development.

After taking him in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft, the Phillies decided to develop the right-hander as a starter and after a decent start to his first full season, he faded early on and eventually needed Tommy John surgery that August. He missed all of 2024 as a result but now has a clean bill of health. Scouts have long thought McFarlane could have a chance to start because of his size, elite arm strength and legitimate three-pitch mix. It starts with his fastball that touches triple digits and a move to a two-seamer has worked with his lower arm slot and allowed him to get groundball outs in 2023. He can miss bats with his upper-80s slider, a breaking ball that flashes plus, and his split-changeup was improving before he got shut down with the elbow injury. The biggest thing McFarlane needs to work on, and the reason why he hasn’t stuck in a rotation to date, is his command of all of his offerings after walking 6.8 per nine in 2023. He reportedly added 10-15 pounds of muscle over the course of his TJ rehab and the Phillies think he might be a bit under the radar after the layoff, even if he does eventually land in the back end of a bullpen.

His combination and projectability earned him an over-slot $1,497,500 bonus as a third-rounder. He continues to intrigue with his upside while battling inconsistency, logging a 4.71 ERA with so-so underlying numbers in his first two-plus pro seasons. Milbrandt has a high-spin, four-seam fastball that sits at 92-95 and touches 99 with carry and armside run, though it gets hit when he doesn't command it up in the strike zone. He has struggled to develop a reliable breaking ball, with his low-80s curveball operating as a plus pitch at its best but sometimes featuring so much depth that it makes it easy for hitters to lay off. He reintroduced his mediocre slider with similar velocity, but it blended too much with his curve and he'll try to refine a sweepier version in 2025. Milbrandt's upper-80s changeup has some fade and sink, but it's too firm and regressed last year to the point where he could barely throw it for strikes. Despite his athleticism and clean delivery, he walked 13 percent of the batters he faced in 2024. He maintains his velocity throughout his starts, but added strength could help him repeat his mechanics better while also adding more power to his stuff.

That led to him beating Marco Gonzales as the highest pick in school history, going No. 10 overall to the Rockies. Hughes reached Double-A in his first full season in 2023, but got shut down in July and needed Tommy John surgery. He returned in time to make six starts in the Arizona Fall League in 2024. Hughes was able to use his 17 1/3 innings in the AFL to shake some of the rust off and the good news is that his stuff looked pretty much back to where it was pre-injury. His fastball averaged 93 mph and touched 96, thrown with good sink to frequently get ground-ball contact. His cutter-like slider was regularly in the mid 80s, a hard breaker that flashed plus in the past, and he has some feel to spin a slower 80-82 mph curve, though it’s behind the harder breaking ball. HIs upper-80s changeup is starting to improve as well. Throw out Hughes’ surface numbers in the AFL given they came from his first post-surgery innings. He generally was around the zone previously, though his up-tempo delivery could get out of sync and cause timing issues, which in turn would lead to control problems. His ceiling might be somewhat limited, but once he really puts TJ behind him, he could be a big league back-end starter soon.

Lesko was coming off Tommy John surgery when he made his pro debut in 2023, so some of the extreme control problems were excused, but it actually got worse in 2024, so it’s getting harder and harder to blame rust. He put up a 6.96 ERA with a 19.2/25.6 K%/BB% in 84 IP at High-A. If you thought getting traded to Tampa was going to help, he actually put up an insane 31.1% BB% in 14.1 IP with them, so whatever they tried, clearly didn’t work. Just looking at those numbers, even this ranking seems like wishful thinking, but the stuff is still so good, it really does make you want to stay patient. The fastball sits mid to upper 90’s, the changeup is his best secondary and it’s a nasty pitch that can end up double plus, and the curve is another potentially plus pitch. But he’s clearly very far away from putting it all together. He’s a high upside lotto ticket right now. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 7/4.16/1.34/150 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.0,0.15151515151515152,0.0,0.030303030303030304,4.71,,,,43.786982248520715,1,0.25,33.93491124260355,14.938718934911241,0.45,2–4 yr,0.3805554999999998,45.433334,26.25,13.887115780473373,47.555555,0.49274999999999985,Mixed,13.452535651213019,sa3020677,playerId

He won Pacific-12 Conference Pitcher of the Year accolades in 2021, when he ranked fourth in NCAA Division I with 143 strikeouts in 108 2/3 innings, then signed for $1.05 million as a second-rounder. He had Tommy John surgery that September, delaying his pro debut until 2023, and missed all of '24 after a follow-up elbow operation. He bounced back to dominate Double-A hitters this year but has struggled following a promotion to Triple-A. Beck's control and command stand out more than any of his four offerings, the best of which is a solid low-80s slider with impressive depth. His low-90s fastball tops out at 94 mph and doesn't feature much life, meaning it grades as a fringy offering, as does his upper-70s downer curveball. His low-80s changeup has some sink but isn't very effective. Beck is a good athlete who repeats his delivery while working quickly and moving his pitches around the strike zone. He might be the best strike-thrower in the system, which helps him compensate for his so-so stuff. As an amateur, he reminded some area scouts of Shane Bieber at the same stage of their careers, though his ceiling now is more of a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever.

The Blue Jays targeted Barriera with the No. 23 overall pick in the ‘22 Draft, signing him to an above-slot bonus of $3,597,500. Barriera had development staffers buzzing in early ‘24, but he suffered an elbow injury early in the season that required a hybrid Tommy John and internal brace procedure. After losing a crucial year of development, Barriera is scheduled to return to game action in May or June. Prior to that injury, Barriera’s stuff was all the way back. He was hitting 97 mph in spring games a year ago, paired with a slider that projects as a legitimate out pitch at the next level. While the surgery was a major setback, Barriera used the time to get his body in better shape, and the Blue Jays believed they were getting the best version they’ve seen of him yet. He made five rehab starts in the Florida Complex League in 2025 before suffering yet another unfortunate injury -- this time a small fractured piece of his forearm -- and that ended his season in July. Barriera will still only be 22 entering 2026, but his prospect status is wearing thin, regardless of how he's looked in various comebacks. Getting healthy and sticking to the mound in games will be paramount next season, especially with the Jays' pitching pipeline getting all the stronger this year.

Signed for a well-over-slot $3 million as a supplemental first-rounder by the Padres, he dominated while advancing to Double-A in his first full pro season before slumping terribly to start 2024. Sent to the Marlins in a July deal for Tanner Scott and Bryan Hoeing, Snelling logged a 6.01 ERA before the trade and a 3.64 mark afterward. Snelling's fastball dropped from working at 92-95 mph in 2023 to sitting at 91-93 and topping out at 95 last year, but he has recaptured that lost velocity in 2025. His heater lacks movement, so he relies on using a flat approach angle to produce carry up in the zone. His best pitch is a low-80s slurve that also lost velocity and effectiveness in the first half of 2024 before playing as a solid pitch afterward. While Snelling's fading changeup can elicit some ugly swings, it's too firm in the mid-80s and he doesn't land it in the strike zone consistently. His football background shows in his aggressive mentality on the mound, though he challenged hitters less often when he was getting roughed up in Double-A last season. His ceiling doesn't look nearly as high as it did the year before, but the ingredients are still there for at least a No. 4 starter.

He put up a 5.54 ERA with a 22.6/8.8 K%/BB% in 115.1 IP at mostly Double-A. And he doesn’t have the type of stuff to overlook the poor numbers with a pretty average at best 4 pitch mix. The fastball and sinker sit 93 MPH, the slider is solid and the changeup is still developing. He’s a bull on the mound at an athletic 6’3”, 210 pounds, and this is 2nd straight year of staying healthy and racking up innings. He was also heating up in the 2nd half with a 3.64 ERA and 28.3/7.7 K%/BB% in his final 54.1 IP, showing that great 2023 was not a complete mirage. If you combine both seasons, he has a 3.58 ERA with a 233/79 K/BB in 219 IP, and you have to take into account that he was a 20 year old in the upper minors all season this year. It’s a workhorse #4 type profile right now, but coming into his age 21 year old season, I think there is upside in here for more with continued refinement. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.53/1.38/40 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.16/1.32/152 in 165 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9663865546218487,0.8151260504201681,0.8907563025210083,0.9663865546218487,90.76,88.88888888888889,,,36.094674556213015,2,0.5,49.37842428227044,76.27644849879465,1.0,0–1 yr,-4.402777799999999,100.0,55.0,87.8009345496384,25.0,0.6799999999999999,SP,66.76042054733728,sa3020707,playerId

He’s moved up exactly one level per season since with stops at Single-A Palm Beach (2023), High-A Peoria (2024) and Double-A Springfield and a stint in the Arizona Fall League mixed in last year. His results seemed to hit a wall in the Midwest League, but the former Torero has bounced back nicely in his age-23 season. Throwing from a low three-quarters slot, the 6-foot-3 southpaw has added some velocity with Springfield and now is in the 91-95 mph range with enough ride to get decent whiffs. His slider has long been his best pitch with good depth to play off that heater and generate misses, and he’s added a cutter to keep righties off-balance. His mid-80s changeup has shown improved movement in recent years but still doesn’t miss many bats, making another option necessary against opposite-side bats. He can also flip in a 79-81 mph curveball to steal strikes. Even with the added velocity, Mautz’s control has steadily improved throughout his time in pro ball, and he has enough pitches in his arsenal to keep getting starting looks. The Cardinals tried him out in the bullpen in the AFL (in part because he already had plenty of innings from the summer), and he still might profile best there if splits against righties become more of an issue at higher levels. His 2025 trajectory has still reinforced his place in St. Louis’ pitching pipeline.

After signing for full slot at $3,182,200, the southpaw pitched two months at High-A Peoria before undergoing surgery to remove loose bodies in his left elbow. He made seven Arizona Fall League appearances to make up for some of the lost time. He returned to the Midwest League to begin 2024, was promoted to Double-A Springfield in early June and struck out 20 in 14 2/3 innings before hitting the injured list again with elbow inflammation. He was considered healthy to begin spring but opened the season on the IL and underwent Tommy John surgery that will keep him out until the middle of 2026. The 6-foot-3 left-hander can wow evaluators with sidearm mechanics that make virtually his entire arsenal tough to touch. He regained some velocity in 2024, back to 90-93 mph with his fastball. The pitch is tough to read with such a flat approach angle, leading to a higher whiff rate than many faster heaters. His upper-70s sweeper breaks hard gloveside, and lefties particularly can do little but wave at it. His 79-82 mph changeup can be a weapon against righties too as a cambio with good separation and almost equal horizontal break to the slider except going the other way. The former Beaver has also incorporated a mid-80s cutter for a sharper bridge pitch. The break on his stuff in all directions can make it difficult to land in the zone at times, but it can still work with the amount of goofy swings Hjerpe elicits. Health has been a consistent issue for Hjerpe as a pro, and he’ll be 25 when he returns to the professional mound, at which time the calls for him to move to the bullpen might be louder than ever.

He dominated out of the gate for Single-A Fredericksburg (1.93 ERA, 54 strikeouts in 42 innings) in his first full season and was promoted to High-A Wilmington in June 2023. He made only six starts in the South Atlantic League before being shut down and underwent Tommy John surgery that September. Bennett did not pitch in the Minors in 2024 as he recovered and rehabbed from the elbow procedure. Standing at 6-foot-6, the southpaw touched 97 mph in that first full season but often sat more in the 91-94 mph range but with a tailing two-seamer. He couldn’t hold that velocity as 2023 wore on in a sign that the elbow was an issue but is back to that range in 2025. His mid-80s changeup works as his best pitch, a true fader with decent separation and good armside movement. The sinker and changeup helped drive impressive groundball rates at every stop. Another mid-80s option in his slider projects more like an average pitch. Bennett didn’t walk more than two batters in any of his 15 appearances in 2023, but the control has been closer to average in his return.

He tried to rehab the injury but wound up having Tommy John surgery in January 2022, missed his junior season at Arkansas and signed for an over-slot $1.5 million with the White Sox as a second-rounder. Chicago moved him to the bullpen by mid-2024 and chose not to protect him on its 40-man roster this November, setting the stage for the Guardians to grab him in the Rule 5 Draft. Pallette works at 94-96 mph and touches 98 with high spin rates on his fastball. His mid-80s slider has surpassed his low-80s downer curveball as his best secondary offering, though both can be plus pitches at their best. He can fool hitters with the depth on his mid-80s changeup, though it has more plane than life and can get pounded if he doesn't locate it well. Because he's not especially tall and has an upright delivery, Pallette creates more downhill plane than extension, so he needs to command his fastball up in the zone to be effective. He's throwing more strikes as a reliever than he did as a starter, and he looks like a potential setup man. Per Rule 5 guidelines, he'll have to stick on Cleveland's big league roster throughout the 2026 season or else be placed on waivers and offered back to the White Sox for half his $100,000 draft price.

He barely pitched as freshman at Texas A&M before spending a year at San Jacinto (Texas) JC and then strained his rotator cuff at Texas Tech in 2021. After avoiding surgery and spurning the Twins as an 11th-rounder that summer, he won Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Year accolades and turned pro as a Cubs fifth-rounder in 2022. He won their Minor League Pitcher of the Year award in 2024, but he missed the first two months of this season with a lat strain before blowing out his elbow in August, resulting in Tommy John surgery that will cost him all of 2026. Birdsell gets a lot of swings and misses in and out of the strike zone with his fastball, which sits at 94-96 mph and tops out at 98 with a nice mix of carry, armside run and command. His mid-80s slider features two-plane depth and grades as a plus pitch at its best. His upper-70s curveball has similar shape and is a more effective change of pace than his actual upper-80s changeup with mild fade that he barely uses. Hitters don't see the ball well against Birdsell, who has an upright delivery with one of the shortest arm actions you'll see and precious little extension. He repeats his mechanics well, pounds the strike zone and locates his fastball with precision. His medical history may have hurt his stock in the 2022 Draft, but he has been healthy for the last three years and looks like an innings-eating No. 4 starter.

Like Mazur, he has plus control of a 95 MPH fastball that doesn’t have a great movement profile, although Birdsell’s fastball missed considerably more bats at Triple-A than Mazur’s did. And like Mazur he has an above average slider as his best secondary to go along with a starter’s pitch mix. It all resulted in a 3.91 ERA with a 23.5/5.4 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A. Like Mazur, I’m leaning towards more of a #4 starter as a reasonable upside projection for Birdsell.

It's been difficult to get him on the mound at all since signing, having internal brace surgery in 2023 after two starts and totaling just 6 2/3 IP that season. The organization is cautiously optimistic that perhaps he's slowly turning a corner after a 2024 season that saw all of his stuff pop, albeit for just 23 1/3 innings. Yes, it was a very small sample size, but the 2024 season was the first that Prielipp showed off the first-round caliber stuff that had him on Draft radars in the first place. His fastball averaged a tick over 94 mph in shorter stints, touching 97 mph, and he was up to 94 mph in bullpen sessions in early camp this year while not going full-tilt. His upper-80s slider missed bats at a 56 percent clip, but it may have been his 85-86 mph changeup that was his best secondary, thrown with a ton of deception and generating a 62 percent miss rate. Prielipp showed last year that he can land all three of his pitches in the strike zone, and all three get swings-and-misses. The Twins will lean into the cautious part of cautious optimism because of the injury history and manage his workload. He's still seen as a starter long-term, though some feel he could impact the big league staff at some point this year in a relief role.

After missing much of his junior season with forearm stiffness, he was the Razorbacks' top starter in 2022 and joined the Cubs as a ninth-rounder. He hasn't let a well-below-average fastball stop him from reaching Triple-A Iowa midway through his second full pro season and functioning as the I-Cubs' most effective starter in 2025. Noland's two- and four-seam fastballs sit at 90 mph and rarely reach 92, so he just doesn't throw them very often. His order of preference for his six-pitch repertoire is as follows: upper-80s cutter, low-80s slider, upper-70s curveball, mid-80s changeup, two-seamer, four-seamer. His slider is his lone offering that grades as better than average, and his curveball is his only other pitch that even reaches that standard. Nevertheless, Noland makes his kitchen-sink approach work. He consistently locates all of his pitches -- save his changeup -- where he wants them, though his need to work around the plate rather than challenge hitters had led to just average walk rates in Triple-A. It's unclear whether he has enough stuff to succeed in the Majors but he's on the verge of getting a chance to find out.

He made only four starts in his first full season because of shoulder problems but thankfully avoided the injured list entirely in his age-21 campaign. He was a California League end-of-season All-Star after posting a 3.00 ERA and a 1.18 WHIP with 89 strikeouts in 72 innings for Single-A Lake Elsinore and finished out the year with seven starts in High-A Fort Wayne. Throwing from the lower range of a three-quarters delivery, the sturdy 6-foot-1 right-hander ran his fastball up to 97 mph last season and generally sat 92-95. There was some tailing action on the pitch as he tended to land it up and armside. His 79-82 mph slider played well nicely off the heat, dropping just as it reached the plate to fool batters to his gloveside. The slider had a 44 percent whiff rate on its own, though it hasn't played nearly to that standard in 2025. An 85-87 mph changeup didn’t get much chase outside of the zone, and lefties handled Lowe much better than their right-handed counterparts as a result. Lowe throws enough strikes to keep him in Minor League rotations for now, but there isn’t a ton of projection left in his frame. The fastball-slider combination should work in shorter stints if he ever needs to head to the bullpen, and after a healthy 2024, there is certainly an arrow pointed up next to his name.

The Dodgers liked him enough as a pitcher to take a 17th-round flier on him, signing him for $125,000. He wowed evaluators inside and outside of the organization when his stuff took a jump in his 2023 pro debut, then regressed physically last year before getting back on track this summer. Martin's fastball is back to sitting in the mid-90s and topping out at 99 mph. While it features carry, it can straighten out at times and get hammered if he doesn't locate it well. His best offering is a mid-80s slider and he also will spin some upper-70s curveballs to give hitters a different look. Just 6 feet tall, Martin is more athletic and electric than physical, and he works with an up-tempo delivery. To remain a starter as he climbs through the Minors, he'll need to refine a mid-80s changeup that he struggles to throw for strikes and also improve his fastball command. If he can't stick in the rotation, he could become a dynamic two-pitch reliever.

When he turned his focus to only pitching, he showed enough potential that the Royals took him in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft, signing him to a $500,000 bonus. The Royals had an innings limit on Zobac in his first full year of pro ball, and he split it between Single-A and High-A. In 2024, they took off the reins and Zobac broke out, posting a 3.64 ERA between High-A and Double-A across 126 innings en route to Royals’ Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors. Zobac’s stuff plays up because of his plus command. He knows where to put the ball and goes right at hitters, evidenced by his 5.6% walk rate in 2024. His strikeout rate between the two levels was 23.8%, and he doesn’t blow hitters away, but his pitchability and command has helped him. Zobac’s fastball is a high-spin 92-94 mph heater with good carry that touched 97 at Double-A. His mid-to-upper 80s slider is a plus pitch that misses bats with good shape and location to the glove side, and he flashed a fringe-average mid-80s changeup that he needs to continue to refine. He changed the grip on that pitch a few times in ‘24 but is still tinkering to find something he’s most comfortable with, and he’ll need it against lefties at the higher levels. Better accustomed to a starter’s workload in 2024, Zobac held up throughout a career-high year in terms of innings. He’s athletic with a repeatable and simple delivery that helps him command the ball so well, and he gets high marks for his intelligence on the mound and in-game prep. From becoming a full-time pitcher in 2022 to reaching Double-A by his second full pro season, Zobac has moved quicker than maybe even the Royals originally thought he would. His fastball-slider combo would fit well in a Major League bullpen, but the development of a third pitch will be key to his upside as a starter.

He certainly looks the part at an athletic 6’3”, 185 pounds. His stuff is good with a low to mid 90’s fastball that has a great movement profile and is a bat missing weapon, to go along with an above average slider and solid changeup. And he has plus control over the entire arsenal. The final box is that he has upper minors production too with a 3.25 ERA and 28.6/6.2 K%/BB% in 55.1 IP at Double-A. He wasn’t quite as good at High-A with a 3.95 ERA and 20.0/5.2 K%/BB% in 70.2 IP, so I would temper expectations a bit, but there is a lot to like here. He definitely falls into that pitching prospect bucket that I like to take shots in, but Zobac is still probably more for medium to deeper leagues than shallower ones right now. – 2025 Projection: 1/4.30/1.32/35 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.05/1.25/154 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.32499999999999996,0.3416666666666667,0.8416666666666667,0.6,49.03,61.53846153846154,42.85714285714286,58.06451612903225,47.14003944773175,4,1.0,51.30759232496206,49.82715731373672,1.0,1–2 yr,0.7777777000000015,40.66666759999998,85.0,48.014647334121015,22.777777000000015,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,43.323258270354444,sa3020875,playerId

Twelfth-round pick Tyrone Taylor has spent time in the big leagues the past two years, and while Tyler Gough is rehabbing from Tommy John surgery, he’s still a well-regarded pitching prospect who went in Round 9. Perez was a college senior taken in the 11th round who didn’t really register on the prospect radar until this season, when an uptick in velocity has led to better results and enabled him to pitch his way from High-A Everett to Double-A Arkansas. An undersized right-hander at 5-foot-10, Perez is all about strikes and spin. His fastball has ticked up to averaging around 93 mph. It’s not a difference-maker, but his ability to hold and command his velocity in longer starts has helped him improve. He has two different sliders he throws more than the heater, and both are effective -- a shorter gyro-like breaker at around 87 mph and a low-80s sweeper. Helping all of his stuff play up is his ability to fill up the strike zone with all of his offerings. His walk rates continue to be very low, even as he climbs the ladder. His ceiling might be limited because of the lack of a true out pitch or above-average heat, but he could pitch his way into a No. 5 starter/swingman role in the big leagues.

After he made a strong pro debut the following year, the Cubs dealt him and outfield prospect Zyhir Hope to Los Angeles for Michael Busch and Yency Almonte in January 2024. Ferris earned Dodgers organization Pitcher of the Year honors after placing third in the Minors among pitchers age 20 or younger with 145 strikeouts in 126 2/3 innings and finishing the season with a 2.54 ERA in seven Double-A starts. Ferris' fastball sits at 92-95 mph and touches 97, and his combination of extension, flat approach angle and carry make it difficult to barrel. Los Angeles had him scrap a low-80s sweeper that Chicago had helped him develop in favor of a harder, tighter mid-80s slider that he throws more easily for strikes and looks like a plus offering. His upper-70s downer curveball has similar upside, though it wasn't as effective in 2024 as he spent more time focusing on his new slider. Ferris' mid-80s changeup shows flashes of becoming a solid offering but could use more consistent fade and sink, and upgrading it will be a point of emphasis in 2025. He operates with a somewhat complicated delivery that can get out of sync, but he's doing a better job of repeating it and throwing strikes as he gets stronger. He has drawn physical comparisons to Blake Snell and has better stuff and mechanics at the same stage of their careers.

He put a 3.39 ERA with a 29.2/10.5 K%/BB% in 98.1 IP at High-A and a 2.54 ERA with a 21.3/11.5 K%/BB% in 28.1 IP at Double-A. The stuff is good, but it’s not really standout with a low to mid 90’s fastball, two good breaking balls, and a lesser used, but good change. He gets a lot of “looks the part” extra hype as a 6’4”, 195 pound lefty with an athletic delivery, but as is, it might be a back end profile. The reason why I was so quick to jump on him, and why he gets lots of love, is because we try to project who a player could be in the prospect world, and at his young age with his projectable frame, you can definitely dream on a mid rotation starter or better with an extra tick on the fastball and continued refinement. Again, I like him a lot, but I would be hesitant to put too high a value on him right now. I’m staying a little cautious here.

He made just 10 appearances in his first full season in 2023 before he needed Tommy John surgery. He missed all of the 2024 season as a result but is back with a clean bill of health in 2025. The early returns on Cox’s stuff coming back have been good, and it’s still his feel for spin that stands out. He has a plus curve with huge spin rates, 1-to-7 shape and sharp bite. He can run his fastball up to 95 mph with good life, and he has feel for what could eventually be an average changeup. Before he got hurt, he had worked on both a slider and a cutter to expand his arsenal. Cox had added strength before the injury and there could be more in the tank the further removed from surgery he gets. He repeats his delivery well and has shown the ability to throw strikes with all of his offerings. This year will be about getting a full, healthy season in, with plenty of time to reach his mid-rotation ceiling. Last Prospect 29 T.J.

After signing for $2.8 million as the 26th overall pick, Schultz worked just 27 innings in his 2023 pro debut while dealing with a flexor strain and a shoulder impingement. He stayed healthy in 2024 and earned Southern League Pitcher of the Year accolades by posting a 1.48 ERA and a 73/17 K/BB ratio in 61 innings following a promotion to Double-A in late May, though he hasn't been nearly as dominant this season. With his 6-foot-10 frame and low three-quarters arm slot, Schultz creates exceptional horizontal movement on a wipeout slider that continues to gain velocity -- now sitting in the low 80s and reaching 88 mph. He has boosted his fastball from 89-92 mph in high school to 93-97 with a peak of 99 mph as a pro. He blows four-seamers by hitters up in the strike zone but doesn't miss many bats when he tries to sink heavy two-seamers, generating a lot of ground-ball contact instead. Schultz has done a nice job honing an upper-80s changeup that can get a bit firm but is an effective offering that fades in an opposite direction from his slider. He has advanced body control for a pitcher who is so large and so young, and his control and command both grade as better than average. His frame, arm angle and slider prompt inevitable comparisons to Randy Johnson, but Schultz is a much more polished pitcher at the same stage of development.

Even the Baby Johnson nickname might not fit, as Randy Johnson had an insane 318 walks in 400.1 minor league IP before getting the call to the bigs. Schultz is 6’9”, 220 pounds with an almost sidearm lefty delivery that he uses to fire a mid to upper 90’s fastball and double plus slider (he also mixes in a cutter and a change). He sliced through the minors with absolutely no problem, putting up a 2.24 ERA with a 32.1/6.7% K%/BB% in 88.1 IP at mostly Double-A. Having that level of control as a 20/21 year old at that size with that kind of stuff is really mind blowing. He’s not a finished product as he’s yet to eclipse 4 IP in any outing of his career and he needs to continue to work on a good third/fourth pitch, but the combination of floor/upside is simply off the charts. Other than Roki Sasaki (who really shouldn’t be considered a prospect), and Painter now that he’s healthy, there is no other pitching prospect I would take over Schultz. – 2025 Projection: 3/3.71/1.24/82 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.05/1.01/230 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.46218487394957986,0.3865546218487395,0.1512605042016807,0.15966386554621848,32.17,96.55172413793103,60.0,,98.0276134122288,3,0.75,79.92826594012428,48.885393079043496,1.0,0–1 yr,-4.0305556,98.3666672,70.0,47.114118003713045,20.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,51.874686541670876,sa3020949,playerId

He had been hitting and pitching for his high school team in New York’s Westchester County, hardly a baseball hotbed, and focused exclusively on pitching during his junior year. He didn’t turn 18 until two months after the Rays picked him and signed him for $597,500. He was extremely raw, and it looked that way during his professional debut in 2023. But Gill Hill may have improved as much as any player in the organization last year, posting a 3.15 ERA in 108 2/3 innings over 22 outings for Single-A Charleston in his first full season. Last spring, Gill Hill put on more muscle on his 6-foot-2 frame and shifted his arm slot up to an upper three-quarters delivery, which led to improved velocity and more depth on his offspeed stuff. His primary pitch is a fastball in the 93-95 mph range, touching 96-97, although his velocity faded a bit toward the end of his first full season. He complements that with a low-80s slider, a cutter in the mid-to-upper 80s and the occasional changeup that helped him limit lefties to a .650 OPS last year. Especially for such a young player -- he turned 20 last September -- Gill Hill displayed impressive control, walking only 2.2 batters per nine innings. Arm slot consistency played a part in that, but he has also shown impressive maturity and intent despite his inexperience. The right-hander doesn’t have a true plus pitch at this point, but the depth of his arsenal and his feel for using it should keep him on a faster-than-anticipated track toward the Majors.

His nasty stuff has plus potential across the board with excellent movement on all of his pitches. The mid 90’s fastball is a bat missing weapon, he can throw the plus breaking ball both in and out of the zone, and the changeup flashes plus as well. And while he’s not a control artist, he has solid command over all of his pitches, especially relative to his age. It resulted in a 3.15 ERA with a 24.2/6.2 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at Single-A. If he keeps getting stronger, there could be another tick or two of velocity in here at peak, and his delivery is so easy he certainly has the potential to end up with plus command at peak too. He’s young and needs to refine his game all around, but there is considerable upside in here, and the floor is about as high as it gets for a 19 year old pitcher in A ball. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 12/3.69/1.18/167 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6774193548387097,0.0967741935483871,0.9516129032258065,0.5806451612903226,56.09,31.999999999999996,,,63.708086785009854,2,0.5,42.921926364234054,51.481174227481915,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.6555555999999996,69.8666672,55.0,56.773852348244574,25.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,46.77156699671006,sa3020972,playerId

Then there are the under-the-radar types like Bohorquez, who signed out of Venezuela for just $10,000 in January 2023 at the ripe old age of 18. He didn’t jump off the page during his Dominican Summer League debut after signing, but opened a lot of eyes by pitching his way from the Florida Complex League to full-season Fort Myers during his U.S. debut in 2024. After a ho-hum start to 2025, something seemed to click in the second half, with the right-hander posting a 2.47 ERA and .185 batting average against from July 1 through the end of the season, a span that included a solid stretch of six outings up in High-A to close out the year. Bohorquez can miss bats with all four of his pitches, as evidenced by his 27.2 percent strikeout rate in 2025, and he racked up a better K rate up a level in Cedar Rapids. His fastball now averages close to 95 mph and is up to 98 as a starter with good carry. His 88-90 mph slider could be a true out pitch in time and he continues to register high spin rates with his low-80s curve that features good depth. His changeup remains a work in progress, but it also has shown depth when he’s executing the pitch correctly. Command and control have been issues for the 6-foot-1 since he joined the Twins organization, but in that July-September stretch, he walked just 2.47 per nine. That’s still a relatively small sample size and there’s still high variance here, but there’s more of an up arrow next to his name as he approaches his age 21 season in 2026.

But he’s made a big impression through two seasons, first on both the Dominican and Arizona complex circuits in ’23 and then between Single-A and High-A last year. Chalas posted a 4.09 ERA with 72 strikeouts and 26 walks in 50 2/3 innings (all in relief) between Visalia and Hillsboro in his age-20 campaign. His 32.1 percent strikeout rate was third-highest among 40 D-backs Minor Leaguers with at least 50 frames in 2024. Standing 6-foot-3, the right-hander drops and drives well from atop the bump, generating plus-plus velocity that regularly touches the upper 90s. Low-level hitters just can’t handle that level of velocity, and right-handers struggled with Chalas’ heater coming up and in. He plays off it with a mid-80s slider that flashed plus with sharp gloveside dive out of a lowish arm slot. Chalas didn’t have a changeup in ’24, and lefties punished him appropriately with a .463 slugging percentage, compared to .291 for righties. The D-backs challenged him to find a third pitch, and it looks like a sinker-splitter hybrid (i.e., the splinker) may win out after offseason work. That would be a good fit for such a hard thrower with that release point, but picking up such a unique pitch isn’t as easy as Paul Skenes or Jhoan Duran make it look. Still, Chalas’ continued breakout has many across the industry intrigued, including Arizona, which won’t rule out trying Chalas as a starter the more he proves himself stateside. His control was solid for a reliever, especially late in the 2024 season, and it’s worth trying out Chalas’ stuff in a longer role before he knocks on the door of the desert.

CC to the Junior College World Series in 2021 and 2022. Named national juco pitcher of the year in '22 after leading that level in victories (14) and strikeouts (160 in 93 1/3 innings), he joined the Rangers as an 11th-rounder. After getting tattooed for a 6.36 ERA in his 2023 pro debut, he established himself as the system's best lefty last year while posting a 2.29 ERA, .196 average-against and 148/31 K/BB ratio while advancing from Single-A to Double-A. He was enjoying another strong year in the upper Minors in 2025 when the Rangers dealt him to the D-backs at the Deadline in the trade for Merrill Kelly. Drake dedicated himself to bettering his strength and conditioning after the 2023 season, dropped 25 pounds off his 6-foot-5 frame and began moving more explosively down the mound. He went from operating with an 88-90 mph fastball at Walters State to dealing at 92-94 and reaching 96 with carry. He also showed better feel for spin, with his low-80s curveball missing plenty of bats and his slightly harder slider flashing as a solid offering as well. His low-80s changeup with fade and sink works well in concert with the shape of his heater. Though Drake had a track record of providing strikes, improved core strength, balance and athleticism helped him upgrade his control even more. His combination of size and a short arm action provides some deception, as does his flat approach angle. If he can continue to get more advanced hitters to chase his curveball and changeup, he could make it as a No. 4 starter.

His K%/BB% dropped from 33.9/6.5 at High-A to 24.4/13.4 in 20.1 IP at Double-A. But just because I knew not to buy into the High-A numbers doesn’t mean I don’t like him as a prospect. He’s a 6’5” lefty with good control over a good fastball and good curveball, to go along with a changeup and slider as well. It’s probably a #4 upside type, but there is definitely mid rotation upside in here too. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.16/1.31/141 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.73109243697479,0.7394957983193278,0.6428571428571428,0.8319327731092437,73.06,73.6842105263158,,,33.72781065088757,2,0.5,42.81986400913526,62.47595240319734,1.0,0–1 yr,-0.9805555999999989,61.766667199999986,55.0,68.1907858009592,25.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,50.28918705043164,sa3021723,playerId

His fastball sat only 89.8 MPH at Single-A, which makes me want to put him in a back end starter bucket and call it day, but I’m fighting that urge. He has the secondary skills to not get too caught up on the velocity. He put up a 3.66 ERA with a 27.8/5.6 K%/BB% in 83.2 IP split between Single-A and High-A. The fastball may not be fast, but it can miss bats, and the changeup and slider are both good pitches which can miss bats and induce weak contact. Tack on plus control, and this is a profile that can actually work as a mid rotation fantasy starter. It’s also a good sign the Cleveland targeted him in the Spencer Horwitz trade.

While the Mariners may have made more noise in signing some elite-level hitters on the international market, they weren’t afraid to go after Martinez, whom they signed for $600,000 in January 2023, adding to a class headlined by Felnin Celesten. In Martinez's two stops heading into 2025, the Dominican Summer League and the Arizona Complex League, he showed his raw stuff can get hitters out -- when he knows where it’s going. He struggled to find consistency for much of his first taste of full-season ball this year, but was having his best month in July when he was sent to the Pirates in the Caleb Ferguson trade. There are still plenty of reasons to be high on Martinez: his athleticism, his size -- he’s 6-foot-4 -- and his power stuff. The teenaged right-hander has seen velocity gains in the early stages of his career, and his fastball now sits around 94-95 mph and touches the upper 90s, and he can really sink it to get ground-ball outs. While his changeup was his better secondary pitch in the DSL, his slider has now caught up and surpassed it. In the DSL, Martinez did a nice job of being in and around the strike zone, even with his upticks in velocity. He didn’t replicate that when he came stateside and his command issues after walking seven batters per nine in the ACL -- and 5.5 per nine in the California League at the time of the trade -- have raised some reliever-risk flags. He's pitched all of the 2025 season at age 19, so there’s no reason to restrict him just yet, but he’ll need to seriously refine his command to remain in a rotation.

He logged a 3.12 ERA with 58 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings as the youngest starter in the Florida State League. Extremely advanced for his age, Benitez already owns a plus low-80s changeup with significant fade and sink. He has added 20 pounds since turning pro, boosting his two- and four-seam fastballs into the low 90s with a peak of 96 mph, though both could use more consistent action. He improved the shape of his upper-70s slider last year, turning it into a sweeper that should become a solid pitch once it gains more power. With a quick arm and explosive movement down the mound, Benitez creates more extension than most 6-foot-1 hurlers. His control and command can waver at times, but he's athletic and repeats his delivery well, so he should gain more consistency as he gets stronger.

That’s where Noah Schultz -- now the top left-handed pitching prospect in the game after the White Sox took him in the first round of that Draft -- and Izzi were teammates. Izzi showed enough for the Mariners to take him in the fourth round, going over slot with $1.1 million to sign him away from his Wichita State commitment. It was a slow rollout for the right-hander, not pitching after signing and throwing just 18 1/3 innings in the Arizona Complex League in 2023. But the gloves came off in 2024 and Izzi threw well, topping 100 IP for full-season Modesto. After opening 2025 with an oblique injury, he came into his own by midsummer and was then dealt to the Diamondbacks as part of the Deadline deal for Josh Naylor. Izzi is pitching at age 21 for the 2025 season, and the 6-foot-3 right-hander built a pretty good foundation to work from. His fastball typically sits at least 94 mph and can touch as high as 97 at times, and he does a very good job of separating his four-seamer up in the zone and his sinking two-seamer down. His low-80s sweeper has the chance to be a solid pitch that misses bats. He didn’t have a great feel for his changeup with Modesto. Whether that necessitates a move to the bullpen remains to be seen, although there is some thought that because of his excellent separation between his two fastballs, he might be able to stay in a rotation without a changeup. His splits were near-even before the trade, and his control had shown steady improvement, aiding the belief that he should still get rotation looks with Arizona.

Harris, Harris played three years at High Point as a third baseman/right-hander before his elbow gave out in 2021 and required Tommy John surgery. He transferred to NCAA Division II UNC Pembroke, missed most of the next season before performing well as a two-way player in 2023, going undrafted in large part because he was 24 years old. Signed as a nondrafted free agent for $10,000 after he earned Coastal Plain League pitcher of the year accolades that summer while topping the circuit with a 0.30 ERA, he posted a 1.52 ERA and a 36 percent strikeout rate while advancing to Double-A in his first year-plus as a pro. Harris's fastball explodes on hitters, coming out of an over-the-top arm slot and arriving at 94-97 mph with tremendous carry and riding action. His 79-82 mph curveball and 83-85 mph slider both play very well off his heater thanks to their quality depth, with his curve slightly more effective and grading as well above-average at times. He has shown a low-80s changeup with some fade and tumble in the past but has mostly scrapped it in pro ball. Harris is athletic and gets down the mound extremely well, creating a combination of a high slot and quality extension that is highly unusual. He has provided strikes throughout his college and pro career, and he shouldn't need much more time in the Minors. The Giants are tempted to try him as a starter, though he might be best suited for overpowering hitters for two or three innings at a time.

But after posting the Draft League’s best fastball velocity, the right-hander signed with the Cardinals for $500,000 in July 2023, thus becoming St. Louis’ first player signed out of Taiwan. He opened his first full season at Single-A Palm Beach and dominated the Florida State League with a 2.79 ERA and 123 strikeouts in 116 innings. Lin was the only Palm Beach pitcher to exceed 100 mph in 2024, and he did it 12 times and touched 101 on May 25. He typically stayed more in the 95-98 mph range with his four-seamer, and while the heater had ample armside run, it didn’t come with great ride, causing it to play below the velo. His 86-89 mph changeup was a much better whiff-heavy pitch with 50.8 percent of swings coming up empty against it. The separation off the fastball and similar horizontal movement befuddled many hitters. Lin could also work in a mid-80s slider, but without high spin rates, it will likely be less effective higher up the chain. None of Lin’s pitches averaged gloveside break in the FSL, and that will be a focus entering year two. For a pitcher who once walked 24 batters in 15 2/3 innings in the Northwoods League, Lin showed a spectacular turnaround when it came to control in the FSL with just a 7.8 percent BB rate. That will be challenged against more patient hitters at High-A and above, but entering his age-23 season, Lin is more raw than many arms his age and could continue to hone his sharpness on the mound.

Combined at the three levels, he posted a 3.88 ERA in 27 games (15 starts) with 137 strikeouts and 40 walks over 99 2/3 innings. Johnston appears to have a much better feel for his three-pitch mix than he did in college. His fastball velocity typically varies from 89-94 mph and can touch up to 96. His split-changeup flashes plus as it continues developing as a true out pitch. His low-80s slider is improving but still a work in progress as it sometimes gives off the look of a slurvy-type offering. Big-bodied at 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, Johnston has the size and arsenal to stay in a starting role, something that may have seemed like a long shot before he was drafted. His strike-throwing ability has clearly improved as a professional, which helped him quickly rise through multiple levels last season. Maintaining that control along with tightening up the breaking ball as a solid third pitch will be the keys to developing into a possible back-end rotation piece, with a floor of a multi-inning lefty reliever out of the bullpen.

The Marlins signed him for a below-slot $4.5 million as the 10th overall pick, then used the savings to float the 2023 Draft's best southpaw (Thomas White) down to the supplemental first round. They pitched together at two levels in their first full pro season, with White outpitching Meyer after they advanced to High-A. Meyer's high-spin slider can be a wipeout pitch at its best, sitting at 83-85 mph with two-plane break, though he tends to fall in love with it at the expense of developing his other secondary offerings. He worked at 93-95 mph and topped out at 98 with his fastball in 2024 after throwing a tick or two harder as an amateur. While his heater has plenty of armside run, it doesn't stand out in terms of carry or approach angle and gets hit hard when he didn't locate it well. Meyer's fading 83-85 mph changeup and downer 77-79 mph curveball both show flashes of becoming solid pitches if he'll trust them more and do a better job of landing them for strikes. He has an athletic delivery that he repeats well and was known for his polish as an amateur, but he issued 62 walks in 85 innings during his first two years as a pro. He may need more time to develop than expected but still has the upside to pitch in the front half of a big league rotation.

He was better at Single-A, but it still came with a 16.3% BB% in 34 IP. That is just an insanely high walk rate over 74 IP, and it’s really hard to overlook as much as I want to overlook it. Maybe if it came with mid to upper 90’s heat, it would be easier, but the fastball sat more low to mid 90’s this year. The reason I want to overlook the poor numbers, is because Meyer still looks like that electric, hyped pitching prospect when you watch him. He’s a projectable and athletic 6’5” who most certainly looks the part. And while the fastball velocity wasn’t off the charts, it explodes out of his hand and is a bat missing weapon. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus to double plus slider and a lesser used, but good changeup. The ingredients and eye test are definitely here to still be a top of the rotation starter, but he clearly has a ways to go with his control/command to get there. I can definitely see scenarios where I would prefer him over Agustin Ramirez and De Los Santos, so placing him 2nd on this list wouldn’t be unreasonable at all. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.87/1.31/180 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.32258064516129037,0.4838709677419355,0.4354838709677419,0.41935483870967744,40.86,59.09090909090908,60.0,,67.85009861932939,3,0.75,58.242637829741895,46.94392324040966,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.9611112000000013,73.53333440000002,70.0,47.5861771321229,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,47.12044658945531,sa3022945,playerId

He was able to jump on a slightly faster developmental track by pitching his way from High-A to Double-A in his first full season, topping all Braves pitching prospects in a host of categories, from innings pitched and strikeouts to K-BB percentage and xFIP. Braun may not have wow stuff, but he sure has a lot of it with a bit of a kitchen sink-type approach to pitching. The six-footer now has as many as five pitches he mixes well to keep hitters guessing. His four-seamer averaged 93 mph in 2024 and topped out at 95 mph with some arm-side run to it and he added a two-seamer with sink at the end of the season and into instructional league play. His 83-84 mph slider is his go-to secondary offering and it elicited a 39-percent miss rate last year, and he also mixes in an upper-70s curve and mid-80s changeup effectively. All of Braun’s stuff plays up because he can throw any pitch for strikes, with a 67-percent strike rate in 2024, and it was encouraging to see him be more effective as he moved up a level with the promotion to Double-A. He doesn’t have that high of a ceiling because of the lack of big stuff, but his feel for pitching gives him a pretty high floor, with a chance to be a solid back-end starter in the big leagues.

The New Jersey native was having a solid first full season with High-A Greensboro when he was dealt to the Orioles in a prospect-for-prospect deal for Billy Cook at the 2024 Trade Deadline, and he pitched to a 3.73 ERA at Double-A over his first eight appearances with his new organization. He made just three outings with Double-A Chesapeake in 2025 before being shut down with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in May. A 6-foot-3 right-hander with a power arsenal, Reilly's ultimate role once he returns to action will be based on his ability to command his high-octane stuff. He's been dogged by fringy control since college, where a consistently high walk rate led Reilly to pitch mostly out of the bullpen. His high-spin fastball flashes as high as 100 mph in relief and sits comfortably in the low-to-mid-90s as a starter, and he uses its impressive induced vertical break to generate a ton of whiffs up in the zone. Reilly compliments the heater with a power slider that he can morph into a cutter against lefties, and he played around with a bigger sweeper and a gyro-type changeup after the trade. Either could develop into average offerings with more usage. Reilly's high-effort delivery is at the root of his difficulty throwing strikes, notably a high arm slot that gives his pitches more movement but also makes his mechanics tough to replicate. Though the walk rate crept back up with the Orioles, they were going to give him a chance to develop into a back-end starter even if his profile hints at an eventual move back to the 'pen, especially post-surgery, where his stuff could play even better in short stints.

He split time between the rotation and bullpen as a freshman in 2021, became the Wildcats’ Friday starter in '22 and truly struggled in his Draft year (8.27 ERA, 1.60 WHIP in 57 2/3 innings), leading to a move back to relief. He went to the Rays in the sixth round in 2023 and signed for roughly slot at $304,800. Nichols steadied the ship as a starter for Single-A Charleston last year (2.90 ERA, 66 SO in 71 1/3 IP) and has been a breakout arm for High-A Bowling Green in his age-23 season. The 6-foot-5 right-hander brings plenty of velocity with a 95-97 mph fastball that can touch 99. The offering doesn’t come with standout movement, however, and it can be pounded by batters able to catch up to the heat, making it play down. A mid-80s slider breaks well horizontally and vertically and has been Nichols’ putaway pitch, helping his K rate take a nice jump this summer. He shows a changeup, too, with roughly 10 mph separation off the heater. He sells it well with his arm speed, leading to whiffs, but it trails the other two pitches in overall usage. Nichols has filled up the zone a ton in pro ball, leading to a walk rate around just five percent in the first half of 2025, but it’s control over command. Batters have teed off enough on his pitches in the heart of the zone to the point where his walk and home run totals have been equal at times with Bowling Green. He might still end up in a bullpen to see how much more velo he can squeeze out, but his starter chances are better now than they were on Draft Day.

In 2019, it was third-rounder Jack Kochanowicz, who got nearly twice over slot. In 2021, they got Mason Albright for seven figures in Round 12. It was Caden Dana’s turn in 2022 ($1.5 million) and the following year came Kent, the Texas prepster who signed for nearly $1 million as an eighth-rounder. His first full season of pro ball was up-and-down, though he topped 100 innings pitched for Single-A Inland Empire as a teenager. During his first full season, Kent largely used a three-pitch mix to attack California League hitters. He can run his fastball up to 95-96 mph, sitting a little below that, and it might be at its best when he sinks it with decent downhill plane and armside run. He relies on it too much, throwing it nearly 70 percent of the time a year ago, so he’ll have to start throwing his slider and changeup more. The mid-80s slider is inconsistent, but it misses bats and has the best chance to become a true out pitch. He has some feel for his low-80s changeup with fade, and he still has an upper-70s curve but didn’t go to it often. In addition to varying his pitch mix, Kent needs to work on his overall command after walking 4.9 per nine a year ago. There’s a starting pitching kit in here with some upside as he pitches all of 2025 at age 20.

He lasted a bit longer than expected and the Giants were delighted to grab him with their supplemental second-round choice at No. 69 overall. He divided his first full pro season between two Class A levels, logging a 4.63 ERA with a 108/37 K/BB ratio in 103 innings. All three of Whitman's pitches grade as at least solid at their best, highlighted by a low-80s slider with horizontal and vertical movement that he commands better than his fastball. He does a good job of locating his heater too, operating at 92-94 mph and touching 97 with riding and tailing action. His low-80s changeup lacks the consistency of his fastball and slider but still misses bats with its fade and sink. Whitman couldn't find the strike zone at Purdue but cleaned up his mechanics at Kent State and now has a more fluid delivery. He struggled with his control in the first half of last season but sliced his walk rate from 12 percent in Single-A to 5 percent in High-A. A legitimate three-pitch starter, he could fit into the middle of a big league rotation if he continues to improve his changeup and strike-throwing.

JC, Hicks transferred to South Carolina for the 2022 season but blew out his elbow in his second start and had Tommy John surgery that March. The Orioles still selected him in the 15th round, but he returned to pitch well in a variety of roles for the Gamecocks the following spring before signing with the Astros as a 13th-rounder. He demonstrated some of the best command in the system while reaching Double-A midway through his first full pro season last year. Hicks' best pitches are his low-90s two-seam fastball with sink and a mid-80s changeup with fade and depth. Since turning pro, he has added a slightly harder four-seamer and a low-80s slider with more sweep to an arsenal that also includes a curveball in the upper 70s and a more traditional slide piece in the low 80s. His breaking stuff pales in comparison to the rest of his repertoire. None of Hicks' six offerings grades as better than average, but they work because he sequences them well and works all four quadrants of the strike zone. His low three-quarters slot creates wide angle and a flat approach trajectory that provides deception. He's on track to help the Astros as a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever sooner than initially expected.

The Rockies are hoping to find out soon enough after taking Sullivan in the second round of the 2023 Draft following his solid turn moving into Wake Forest’s weekend rotation that spring. His smoke-and-mirrors show worked very well during his first full season of pro ball, both with High-A Spokane and Double-A Hartford, as he led all Minor League pitchers with an 8.33 K/BB rate and topped the Rockies in a host of pitching categories. Sullivan uses a lower slot to come at hitters with a kind of upshoot fastball, getting huge carry up in the zone. Even though it only averaged around 88 mph in 2024, the lefty threw it a lot and got decent swing-and-miss on the pitch thanks to that life and his outstanding command of the pitch. There could be a little more velocity in the tank now that he’s had a hip labrum issue fixed, so he might be able to get to 93-94 mph more moving forward. His upper-70s changeup is his best pitch, one that has terrific movement and misses bats in and out of the zone. His sweeping slider can be effective, but he doesn’t locate it as well as his other two offerings. The Rockies will be sure to bring Sullivan along slowly and manage his workload as he’s coming back from the hip issue, but he’s already defied expectations thanks to confidence in his pitch usage, his unusual mechanics and his extreme strike-throwing ways. He’ll be at the upper levels continuing to show that his unusual profile just might work in a big league rotation.

The Rockies are hoping to find out soon enough after taking Sullivan in the second round of the 2023 Draft following his solid turn moving into Wake Forest’s weekend rotation that spring. His smoke-and-mirrors show worked very well during his first full season of pro ball, both with High-A Spokane and Double-A Hartford, as he led all Minor League pitchers with an 8.33 K/BB rate and topped the Rockies in a host of pitching categories. Sullivan uses a lower slot to come at hitters with a kind of upshoot fastball, getting huge carry up in the zone. Even though it only averaged around 88 mph in 2024, the lefty threw it a lot and got decent swing-and-miss on the pitch thanks to that life and his outstanding command of the pitch. There could be a little more velocity in the tank now that he’s had a hip labrum issue fixed, so he might be able to get to 93-94 mph more moving forward. His upper-70s changeup is his best pitch, one that has terrific movement and misses bats in and out of the zone. His sweeping slider can be effective, but he doesn’t locate it as well as his other two offerings. The Rockies will be sure to bring Sullivan along slowly and manage his workload as he’s coming back from the hip issue, but he’s already defied expectations thanks to confidence in his pitch usage, his unusual mechanics and his extreme strike-throwing ways. He’ll be at the upper levels continuing to show that his unusual profile just might work in a big league rotation.

The same issue dogged him while he posted a 6.34 ERA in three college seasons at Lamar and Houston, but he has enjoyed much more consistent success since the Marlins drafted him in the 12th round in 2023 and made him a full-time reliever. He compiled a 1.91 ERA, .164 opponent average and 83 strikeouts in 66 innings while reaching Double-A in his first full pro season. Ekness unleashes 96-98 mph and reaches 100 with armside run on his fastball, showing the ability to produce carry up in the zone or sink at the knees. His heaters elicit plenty of chases and swings and misses, and his sinking version can be downright unhittable. His slider combines mid-80s power with horizontal and vertical action, though he struggles to land it in the zone. While Ekness creates deception with a low three-quarters arm slot and crossfire in his delivery, he also throws with some effort and his mechanics impede his control. He did cut his walk rate from 16 percent in college to 10 percent last year, encouraging progress. He could become a high-leverage reliever if he can harness his slider and provide more strikes.

Drafted by the Mets in the third round of the 2023 Draft, he began his first full professional campaign last season at Single-A St. Lucie and was promoted to High-A Brooklyn after six starts before getting sent to the A’s at the Trade Deadline in exchange for right-hander Paul Blackburn. Between Single-A, High-A and even a couple of outings with Triple-A Las Vegas, he combined for a 4.50 ERA with 121 strikeouts and 45 walks over 136 innings. Morris runs up his four-seam fastball to about 95-96 mph and also throws a sinker with good arm-side run in the 92-95 range. His mid-80s slider has developed into an above-average secondary offering. His mid-70s curveball provides a good variation of pitch speeds, though he is still working to make it a more consistent pitch, along with his improving upper-80s changeup. Morris is athletic with his 6-foot-3 frame. His competitive drive stands out whenever he takes the mound. Discovering the right arm slot that allows for the most consistency is the next big step in his development. How that pans out as he moves through the system will likely determine his long-term role, though he profiles as a back-end starter given his overall pitch mix and solid control.

After the Red Sox drafted him in the 12th round that July, he didn't make his pro debut until the end of the 2023 season. He posted a 3.94 ERA with 118 strikeouts in 89 High-A innings last year and earned a swift promotion to Double-A in 2025. Mullins' fastball operates in the low 90s and tops out at 95 mph, yet it misses plenty of bats because it features tremendous carry up in the strike zone. He'll flash a plus low-80s slider with two-plane depth at times and can turn it into a harder, tighter cutter that's similarly effective. His low-80s changeup lacks the consistency of his other offerings but has quality tumble at its best and helps him keep right-handers in check. Mullins' delivery comes with a big leg kick, a twist that hides the ball behind him and a low release point, all of which help him create deception. He exhibited fringy control in college and during his first full pro season, so he'll need to improve his strike-throwing to become a No. 4 or 5 starter. If not, he could have a future as a multi-inning lefty reliever.

They signed him away from a Vanderbilt commitment for $4.1 million, the equivalent of mid-first-round money and a record for a New England draftee. He proved more polished than expected in his first full pro season, logging a 2.81 ERA with a 120/38 K/BB ratio in 96 innings between two Class A stops and earning top prospect accolades in the High-A Midwest League. White's stuff made a jump in 2024, with his fastball velocity increasing from 92-95 mph to 94-97 with plenty of carry and run. He has always exhibited good feel for spin and switched from a 78-82 mph curveball with depth to an 81-85 slider with significant horizontal action.

White is just 20 and is still learning how to keep his long limbs and delivery in sync, though he threw more strikes following his promotion to High-A in late May. Given the quality of his stuff, he doesn't have to locate his pitches with precision, but if his control and command continue to improve, he could become a No. 1 starter.

He’s not a finished product as he’ll have some bouts of control problems, and he needs to continue to refine all 3 of his pitches really, but for his first year out of high school, that is an insanely impressive first full year of pro ball. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.39/1.15/215 in 185 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9831932773109243,0.9915966386554622,0.26050420168067223,0.9915966386554622,82.63,100.0,90.0,,91.3214990138067,3,0.75,86.47392388908226,83.97537336117878,1.0,0–1 yr,-5.180555600000002,100.0,70.0,85.63911200835364,20.0,0.6799999999999999,SP,69.53760040375914,sa3023268,playerId

The industry had the big right-hander pegged for more like a 5th-7th round pick, but the Braves liked him more than that, taking him in the second round. So far, it’s looking like they were right as Hackenberg pitched his way from High-A to Triple-A in his first full season, leading qualified Braves arms in ERA and batting average against. With as many as five pitches at his disposal, Hackenberg has provided an intriguing combination of missing bats and getting groundball outs in the Minors. He throws both a four- and two-seam fastball, with the former up to 97 and averaging 94.7 mph last year and the latter averaging over 93 mph and leading to high groundball rates. He was sinker heavy in college but started to feature the four-seamer up in the zone more in pro ball with solid results. His best secondary offering is his power two-plane curve that can miss bats, though his changeup also got some swing-and-miss along with weak groundball contact, and he mixes in a hard 90-mph cutter as well. The most encouraging thing with Hackenberg was that his stuff got better and he threw harder as the year went on despite blowing by his season innings high from college. His strike-throwing hasn’t been as consistent as it was with the Hokies, but there’s confidence he’ll be in and around the zone enough to be an innings-eating workhorse in a big league rotation.

He’s a built up 6’2”, 220 pounds with mid 90’s heat, a diverse pitch mix, and a bat missing secondary in his curve. The control is below average and that curve is really his only standout pitch, so even with him beating my expectations, it’s still likely a back end starter with mid-rotation upside. 2025 Projection: 2/4.50/1.41/42 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.09/1.32/145 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,93,0.15833333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.19166666666666665,0.05,12.68,67.85714285714286,,75.0,41.222879684418146,3,0.75,52.592162111392874,26.649256738987507,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.6861111999999991,58.23333439999999,70.0,23.70377718169625,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,33.313366611763314,sa3023304,playerId

They dipped into the prep pitcher market for the first time in Round 4 when they took Baumann out of Florida power Hagerty High School and going over slot to sign him away from Central Florida. He had a very successful first full season in pro ball, finishing with just under 100 innings pitched and touching High-A while spending most of the year at age 19. Baumann is a surprising strike-thrower given his enormous 6-foot-8 frame, with all of his stuff trending in the right direction. He landed his fastball, which averaged around 94 mph for the 2024 season and touched 98, for a strike 72 percent of the time and he did that while working on improving his fastball shape. Baumann entered pro ball relying on a sinker and early in 2024, he would sink the heater at times and have it have carry others, without rhyme or reason. By the end of the year, he has more control over the pitch’s action, and in that last start with High-A Rome, he averaged 95.8 mph with the pitch. Both his fading changeup and sometimes slurvy slider took steps forward as well. The one knock about Baumann had been his inability to miss bats. But while he does lack a true out pitch, he did register a 30-percent strikeout rate from July 1 on, a harbinger of good things to come. The Braves are willing to bet on someone with his strike-throwing capabilities and think he’s perhaps just starting to unlock his considerable potential.

Toronto selected the 6-foot-3 Maroudis in the fourth round of the 2023 Draft and signed him away from an NC State commitment with a $1.5 million bonus. Maroudis was off to a strong start in 2024 with Single-A Dunedin but needed surgery to address his right UCL with an internal brace in late May. Until that surgery, Maroudis had as much upward momentum as any pitcher in this system. It wasn’t quite to the level of Ricky Tiedemann a couple of years ago when he made his big jump, but it was getting there. The surgery was a setback, yes, but Maroudis is still just 20 years old with plenty of development time ahead of him. That's important to note with his pair of fastballs sitting only 89-91 mph following the surgery. He's gone his mid-80s slider a ton for whiffs, and his 78-80 mph curveball gives him another quality breaking ball. The control simply hasn't been there in his return with more walks than strikeouts at times. The Jays prefer to focus on the fact that Maroudis is getting in any work at all against Minor League batters after the lost 2024, and with a full healthy offseason to prepare, there is hope Maroudis could look much more like himself in 2026 and beyond.

The puts his likely return date at some point mid-season, which could be enough time to get the hype rolling again. He had a 0.84 ERA with a 31.6/10.5 K%/BB%. The fastball sat 93.6 MPH, the curve and change got whiffs, and the slider induced weak contact. He also throws a sinker. He’s not the type I love taking the “Tommy John” discount on, but I think he’s worth a shot this late in the rankings as he was on a clear upward trajectory before going down with the injury. If he returns to full health, I don’t see why he can’t pick up from where he left off. Major elbow surgery is just part of the pitching prospect journey.

The Blue Jays selected him in the third round (89th overall) in the 2023 Draft before signing him to an above-slot $1 million bonus. Watts-Brown didn’t pitch professionally in his Draft year, but threw 103 innings between Single-A and High-A in ‘24 with a 4.72 ERA, 131 strikeouts and 60 walks. He was putting up better numbers across the board and had climbed to Double-A when the Blue Jays sent him to the Orioles for Seranthony Dominguez. Watts-Brown has improved his routines since becoming a professional and put on some weight, which has helped him hold up through a season. He has excellent feel for his low-80s slider, which will always be his headlining pitch, and his upper-70s curveball can be a whiff-heavy option too. But he could still benefit from some added juice on his fastball, which sits in the low 90s. Walks were a problem for Watts-Brown at times in ‘24, with a rate of 5.2 BB/9, but he was finding the zone more consistently in his second full season. Pitching at age 23 all year, the 2025 season has proven to be a big bounce back campaign for Watts-Brown. He should continue to get every opportunity to develop as a starter given his gains, though the Orioles likely know how much that slider could play up in shorter relief stints should he have to shift to a bullpen.

He might be known for a bigger number these days: 202. That was the 2023 fourth-rounder’s Minor League-leading strikeout total across all four full-season levels in his first pro season, thus becoming only the second MiLB pitcher with at least 200 K’s in a single year since 2011. He finished with a 2.76 ERA, 0.98 WHIP and .179 average-against, thus cementing his status as MLB Pipeline’s Pitching Prospect of the Year. The most noticeable change from Mathews’ time in college to the pro side was his added velocity. The 6-foot-5 southpaw’s four-seamer went from averaging 91.6 mph in his final year with Stanford to sitting in the 93-96 mph range in 2024. Whether it because of early shoulder trouble or the full-time move to the Major League ball, Mathews has seen that velo drop back again to the 92-94 range in 2025. His 80-83 mph changeup still well off that heater in terms of separation and 11-13 inches of armside movement, and even during the 2025 struggles, it remains at at least a plus pitch. A tight 84-87 mph slider gets ample whiffs against lefties too, while Mathews will flip in the occasional mid-70s curveball for a different breaking look. Some believed Mathews to have some of the best pitchability among prospects entering 2025, but his control has regressed in a major way this summer -- a trend that technically began during his first Triple-A stint in '24. Mathews still flashes midrotation upside, and optimistic evaluators believe he's still finding himself after being sidelined so early in the year. What's clear is that getting Mathews to Major League readiness is going to be more of a process than it appeared coming off his breakout first full season.

I’m not going to put too much emphasis on it either seeing as he was already at a career high in IP, and you have to give humans a chance to adjust to a new level, new team, new coaches etc …, but there is one wrinkle that makes me pause, and that wrinkle is that Triple-A is the only level to use the MLB ball. Every other level uses their own balls, and I mean, the ball is a pretty important factor. Blade Tidwell obliterated Double-A, got called up to Triple-A earlier in the season, and then stunk at Triple-A for a large sample. Everyone hates Blade Tidwell now. Mathews (and Brandon Sproat has a similar story too), didn’t have a large sample at Triple-A, so it’s easy to just hand wave it away, but I do think it’s something to keep in mind. Now just because I’m keeping it in mind, doesn’t mean I still don’t love Mathews. He’s a 6’5”, lefty with a mid 90’s fastball and two whiff machine secondaries in his slider and changeup (he also throws a curve and sinker). He dominated all season (other than at Triple-A) with a 2.76 ERA and 35.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 143.1 IP. And as you can see, he stays healthy, which does matter. I lean towards him being more of a #2 starter than a true ace, but add a star for his health, and he’s knocking on the door of the bigs. I like him a ton. Maybe I just feel the need to knock him down a peg because of my love for Tink, who I have ranked higher than Mathews, while most have it the other way around. The truth is, I love both of them (just Tink more ;). 2025 Projection: 6/3.98/1.32/97 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.59/1.20/190 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.33613445378151263,0.6638655462184874,0.134453781512605,0.29411764705882354,37.54,81.81818181818181,71.42857142857143,,92.3076923076923,3,0.75,76.85050243873773,51.29867585355821,1.0,0–1 yr,-1.1944444999999995,64.333334,70.0,45.686602856067466,20.0,0.5599999999999998,Mixed,44.425638085230354,sa3023407,playerId

The left-hander flashed raw stuff to begin his first full season with Single-A Lynchburg, where he had a 4.67 ERA and 97 strikeouts in 69 1/3 innings, but walks proved to be a problem. Cleveland traded him to the Nationals as part of a three-player return for Lane Thomas at the Trade Deadline, and his numbers were much the same with Fredericksburg. Standing at 6-foot-6, Clemmey still gets low down the bump with good extension and can generate a tough approach angle that gives hitters fits. His 92-96 mph fastball plays up in the top of the zone as a result, and there’s plenty of projection remaining to get him more velo as he works through pro ball. (He’ll still be only 19 for the majority of the 2025 season.) He's also worked with a sinker in 2025 to play into his natural supination. Clemmey has gone away from a slurvier breaking ball to more of a sharper 81-84 mph slider that he can land in the zone or generate chase running away from lefties or in on righties. An upper-80s changeup worked well at Single-A but is the third-best pitch in the arsenal. Clemmey has an uptempo delivery that can be hard to keep consistent at times, leading to the walk rates. Nationals officials would also like to see him work on getting ahead in counts, and they believe an approach change could just as well correct some of his control problems. Clemmey has youth and raw stuff on his side to become a future No. 2 or 3 starter with the right adjustments.

Clemmey is a projectable 6’6” with a mid 90’s fastball, a nasty, bat missing breaking ball, and a developing changeup that led to a 31.5% K% in 92.1 IP at Single-A. The 16.1% BB%, 4.58 ERA, and 1.41 WHIP aren’t nearly as impressive, and shows there is a long way to go with a lot of risk for him to reach his high K, mid rotation starter upside, but like with Hader, Clemmey has a soft landing spot as a potentially impact high leverage reliever as well.

He was a little sharper in the Northwoods League that summer and showed off his premium arm strength back at school in 2023, leading the Phillies to take him in the sixth round. They were cautious during his first full season, sending him to Single-A Clearwater, but he turned out to be a revelation, both in stuff and his ability to command it, and earned a promotion to High-A Jersey Shore. When the Angels traded Carlos Estévez to the Phillies close to the Trade Deadline, they acquired Klassen along with Sam Aldegheri. He was pushed to Double-A and finished the season with a six-inning, no-hit, one-walk, 12-strikeout exclamation point. A 6-foot-2 right-hander, Klassen has always been able to throw hard, but he took big steps forward in pitch design and feel in 2024. His fastball averaged close to 97 mph last year and hit triple digits. His four-seamer had more ride up in the zone than it did in college and he also used a two-seamer with sink. He has two distinct breaking pitches, and both can be nasty when he commands them: a hard 86-mph curveball and a slider up to 90 mph. He does have a seldom-used upper-80s changeup. After walking 7.5 per nine innings in his final year at Minnesota, Klassen improved dramatically in keeping his high-effort delivery in sync in his first year as a pro. Even though the walks ticked back up post-trade, his final start of 2024 gives more confidence those gains might be for real. He has a higher ceiling than any pitcher in the system, but also perhaps the highest variance in outcomes.

He put up a 0.71 ERA with a 39.6/8.3 K%/BB% in 38 IP at Single-A. A 4.22 ERA with a 35.2/9.9 K%/BB% in 21.1 IP at High-A. And then a 5.65 ERA with a 28.3/17.3 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP at Double-A. Age for level isn’t as important for pitcher as it is for hitters, but I think Klassen is a good example for why it still needs to be taken into account. An older, more advanced pitcher can definitely have real advantages over less experienced hitters, which will make them look better than they really are. But the reason it doesn’t matter as much for pitchers, is that stuff don’t lie, and Klassen got that stuff. He throws a plus mid to upper 90’s fastball, which he combines with a plus curve and a potentially plus hard slider/cutter. The control/command is below average, and it’s not great how quickly he fell apart in his first taste of the upper minors, but it’s hard not to fall in love with that stuff. He’s a great proximity upside play with a soft landing spot as a high leverage reliever. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.33/1.36/61 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.79/1.28/182 in 165 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9411764705882353,0.7142857142857143,0.6638655462184874,0.7815126050420168,78.99,89.47368421052632,,90.625,67.25838264299803,3,0.75,73.38654613913975,77.02879114869891,1.0,0–1 yr,-2.505555600000001,80.06666720000001,70.0,78.56313742460966,20.0,0.6799999999999999,SP,62.366745281074344,sa3023440,playerId

He pitched well in the Cape Cod League in the summer of 2022, transferred to Palomar (Calif.) JC and ranked as the best junior college prospect in the 2023 Draft after going 12-1 with a 2.31 ERA and 111/19 K/BB ratio in 78 innings. A third-round pick, his stuff and control regressed during his pro debut last year at High-A. After dealing at 91-95 mph and touching 97 with his fastball at Palomar, Carr worked more at 88-92 and topped out at 94 with his two- and four-seamers in 2024. His once-solid low-80s sweeper also lost some velocity and life, playing as more of an average pitch. He has yet to show much aptitude for a changeup that dropped into the low 80s last year while featuring inconsistent depth. Carr's walk rate also doubled from 6 percent in junior college to 12 percent at High-A as he became reluctant to attack hitters with diminished stuff. His athleticism and arm speed help him overcome a lack of physicality, and offseason workouts have the Yankees optimistic that he's recapturing his Palomar form. If that happens and he adds some strength and polish, he still could become a No. 3 or 4 starter.

Given all of that, the Twins were thrilled with what he was able to accomplish in his first full season, using a very strong July and August in the Florida State League to finish with an organization-leading (among those with 70 or more innings) 10.6 K/9 rate and a solid 3.60 xFIP (fourth among all Minor League pitchers, 18 or younger, with 70 or more IP). He wasn’t able to follow it up in 2025 as a right triceps strain forced him out for nearly the entire season. Soto had made tremendous strides across the board in his one year of pro ball. While his workload was monitored closely last year, his fastball averaged 95.7 mph all year, according to Synergy, and elicited a 33 percent miss rate, with good deception playing a part. He added a two-seamer with a ton of movement that was very effective as well. Halfway through the year, Soto committed to throwing more of a gyro-type slider with depth, something firm, up to 89 mph late in the year that misses bats and he'll continue to focus on the shape and velocity of his breaking pitch. His changeup is at least an above-average pitch with fade. Athletic and with plenty of projection, there could be more in the tank for the Soto as he gets more professional reps, and he was sitting 95-96 mph in early camp work while going at 70-80 percent. He's a decent strike-thrower, which will get better if he can be in the zone more against left-handed hitters. That, along with continued refinement of his pitch usage could allow him to develop into a solid big league starter, though getting healthy will be his first objective.

But the Jacksonville native announced on Draft day that he would honor his commitment to Florida State and, thus, went unselected. Two years later, the Orioles took him 63rd overall, signed him for an over-slot bonus of $1.61 million and pushed him to High-A for his first full season. He was off to a nice start there before the Rays landed him as part of a three-prospect haul for starter Zach Eflin, and he turned in a dominant stretch to finish the year. Baumeister’s arsenal isn’t quite as elite as fellow Trade Deadline pickup Brody Hopkins, but he features a good combination of stuff, strike-throwing and command. He’s a fastball-dominant starter, using his heater more than half the time, and he throws that pitch in the mid-90s with good life and 97 mph in the tank if he needs it. But his curveball is his go-to out pitch, and it’s up there with the best benders in the Rays’ system. The right-hander has a starter’s frame, listed at 6-foot-4 and 224 pounds, and he’s got the makings of a full arsenal with a cutter-y slider and a changeup. It's a little bit challenging to get a read on Baumeister, in part because of how his performance fluctuates. He struggled to limit his walks as a reliever early in his college career, then he got them somewhat under control in the rotation as a Draft-eligible sophomore despite mixed overall results. He was averaging 5.5 walks per nine innings in Baltimore’s system before the trade, then only walked five batters in 29 innings (while, by the way, striking out 44 and only allowing 12 hits) with the High-A Bowling Green. A shoulder injury has kept him from taking that next leap in his first full season as a Ray. Last Prospect 26 T.J.

The Baltimore sample is bigger, so it’s hard to fully trust the control gains, but this wouldn’t be the first time a pitcher has seen big control gains with Tampa, and if he can maintain those gains, he’s a very exciting pitching prospect. He put up a 1.24 ERA with a 41.9/4.8 K%/BB% with Tampa, showing what he’s capable of when he’s hitting his spots. The fastball sits low to mid 90’s, but it can reach the upper 90’s, and it has great shape which makes it a plus pitch that can miss bats. The curve is a beautiful pitch which goes 12 to 6, and he also mixes in a cutter, slider and change. The control gains might not stick, and then he’ll end up in the bullpen, but he’s worth a shot at this point in the rankings in case they do. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/3.96/1.31/148 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4083333333333333,0.11666666666666667,0.7583333333333333,0.25833333333333336,38.01,0.0,,,46.15384615384615,2,0.5,22.884615384615383,32.71611538461538,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.9611112000000013,61.533334400000015,55.0,39.95033477538462,25.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,37.53431752892308,sa3023471,playerId

Owen put those aside by throwing 102 innings across 23 games (22 starts) for High-A Quad Cities in his first pro season. He had a 4.20 ERA with a 1.20 WHIP, an 18.9% strikeout rate and a 7.5% walk rate. Owen is a presence on the mound at 6-foot-6 and 260 pounds. His fastball is 90-94 mph with solid carry and vert to it and uses the top of the zone well. His 86-89 mph slider is smaller, almost cutter-like, misses bats and has potential to be his out pitch, while his 75-76 mph curveball is still developing after he wasn't able to land it much in 2024. His 83-85 mph changeup is near average with sink and gets some chase on it. Owen’s delivery is simple but does have some effort because of his bigger frame, although he likes using that strong presence to his advantage on the mound. Owen looks the part of a big-bodied rotation guy who’s built like a workhorse, so it was good to see him stay healthy across a full season with a lot of innings and a jump from what he had in ‘23. He’ll head to Double-A in 2025 and projects as a back-end starter if he can keep developing his secondaries, but that stuff might tick up in a bullpen, especially against lefties.

That proximity gave Baltimore the inside-track at some early looks at the right-hander in 2023. They made him a 14th-round pick that year and spent over the $150,000 slot value for Day 3 picks to sign him for $450,000. Forret spent his pro debut making that look like a worthwhile investment, experiencing a velocity jump, posting a 28.8 percent strikeout rate as a 20-year-old and finishing at High-A Aberdeen. He built on that breakout with a 1.58 ERA and 91 strikeouts at High-A and Double-A in 2025, while working around lower back discomfort, and was traded to the Rays in the offseason in the Shane Baz move. Forret is a 6-foot-3 righty with a varied pitch mix and a lot of projection, but all his stuff is pointing in the right direction. He has two potentially plus fastballs -- a mid-90s four-seamer that touches 97 and a runny two-seamer. He has two sliders, with the sweeper the best of his secondary offerings. He also throws two changeups, including a kick change, and a splitter. It’s a deep pit of weapons, one that’s proven effective in this age of the pitch mix. Though Forret kept the ball in the strike zone relatively well during his debut, his control picked up even further in year two with a 7.4 percent walk rate. He’s still yet to throw more than 100 innings in a single Minor League season, clouding his ceiling somewhat. The depth of his pitch mix could make him a mid-rotation starter. It’ll at least give his new Rays coaches and coordinators plenty to work with in his new system.

Following a lackluster pro debut last year, he opened 2025 by throwing more strikes than ever at Double-A. He needed just nine starts to earn a promotion to Triple-A, a pleasant development in a farm system thin on pitching prospects. While Sanders' 92-94 mph fastball can touch 97 and is missing more bats in his second pro season than it did in its first, it's still not especially lively. His best pitch this year has been a mid-80s splitter that he uses as a changeup and employs against both lefties and righties. He also owns a pair of average breaking balls, an 82-85 mph slider that has been sharper in the past and a 79-81 mph curveball. Sanders' 6-foot-6 build creates natural extension and angle that help his stuff play up a bit. He halved his walk rate from 10 percent in his pro debut to 5 percent at Double-A to start this season, though his control is better than command. He'll have to locate his pitches well to make it as a No. 4 or 5 starter.

HS, Wolters became the Royals’ second-round selection in the 2023 Draft, signing for an over-slot $2.8 million and decommitting from Arizona. Wolters spent the rest of ‘23 pitching at the Royals’ facility in Arizona and made his pro debut last year, going to Single-A Columbia to start the season instead of being held back in extended spring training like the Royals have done with their prep pitchers in the past. Wolters was solid for the Fireflies with a 4.20 ERA across 14 starts at 55 2/3 innings, and the Royals shut him down in August after he had minor tendinitis and was nearing his innings limit. Strong and physical, Wolters stands 6-foot-4 and certainly looks the part of a starting pitcher. His fastball features ride and run, sitting in the mid 90s during starts last year, but he has touched 99 mph. That velo was down a touch in the early going of 2025 with him sitting more in the 92-94 mph range. His slider has the potential to be his wipeout pitch, a plus offering in the mid 80s that’s tight with hard break. He’s learning how to throw it and trust it more. Wolters worked on his changeup quite a bit in 2024, but it was up and down when he used it in games. That will continue to be a focus pitch for him because he needs a third offering to stick as a starter. With improved consistency, it has the potential to be above average. Wolters has a clean and efficient delivery, repeatable from a three-quarters arm slot. Wolters has the upside of a front-end starter, and he is extremely intelligent and advanced for his age when it comes to preparation and the way he digests information. But it will still take some time for him to develop as he works on pitch execution. He returned to Single-A for 2025 and was slowed after a shoulder issue in the first half.

Though he posted a 6.54 ERA in three seasons with the Raiders, his athleticism and arm strength ranked among the best in the 2023 college pitching class and the Dodgers selected him in the supplemental fourth round. After a strained left oblique and minor arm soreness limited him to 28 1/3 innings in his 2024 pro debut, he was one of the most impressive pitchers in the Arizona Fall League. Swan was at High-A Great Lakes for 2025 when Los Angeles traded him to the Nationals at the Deadline for Alex Call. While it looks like he's just playing catch, Swan works at 94-97 mph and tops out at 101 with his fastball while maintaining his velocity deep into games. His heater features more downhill plane than life and he has yet to develop consistent command of it, so it can get hit hard when he doesn't locate it well. He also can miss bats with two different sliders, one in the low-80s with more depth and a tighter upper-80s version that can climb to 90 mph. Swan also will flash some solid upper-80s changeups with interesting fade, though he doesn't use it very often. He's extremely athletic for a 6-foot-6, 240-pounder and works exclusively out of the stretch. But outside of last year’s AFL, he doesn’t have a long history of throwing strikes as a pro. Washington should develop him as a starter for now, but it's more realistic that he becomes an overpowering reliever.

He is arguably the best athlete in the Rays’ organization, including both position players and pitchers. And that makes sense when you consider his background. He was a two-way player at College of Charleston but didn’t pitch much. He transferred to Winthrop, where he played the outfield and started on the mound. His numbers weren’t great, but the Mariners took a shot in the sixth round of the 2023 Draft for an under-slot bonus of $225,000, eyeing him as a pitcher. He got off to an excellent start for Single-A Modesto last year then went to the Rays as part of the deal for fan favorite Randy Arozarena. Hopkins has the athleticism, size, delivery and stuff to be a front-of-the-rotation starter. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, he has long arms and a loose delivery that includes a surprisingly low release point for someone that big and physical. That helps his stuff play up even more, including a pair of mid-90s fastballs (with a riding four-seamer and the ability to touch the upper 90s, plus a sinker) and a bat-missing slider in the upper-80s with a ton of break. He’s added a cutter and curveball to give him some velocity differential, and he rounds out his arsenal with a changeup that could be at least an average offering. Hopkins should be able to dominate hitters with his athletic delivery and full complement of nasty pitches, headlined by his fastball and slider. But he will have to display better command as he gets into the high Minors. Despite striking out 133 batters in 115 innings last year, he also walked 53 and hit 19 more. His walk rates have crept up a tad in 2025, but the rest of the arsenal is so good that he's become officially the best arm in the system.

He combines that with a tailing mid 90’s fastball that looks like he often has little idea where it is going to end up, and he rounds out the arsenal with a decent, lesser used changeup. It resulted in a 3.05 ERA with a 27.2/10.8 K%/BB% in 115 IP split between Single-A and High-A. There is definite control risk that seems like it will always be a part of his game with that funky delivery, so he very well might end up in the bullpen, but with a just a tad more refinement he could be a high K, mid rotation starter, and Tampa is a great team to bet on for that refinement. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.83/1.29/158 in 145 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8083333333333333,0.75,0.4083333333333333,0.725,68.94,91.66666666666666,,,60.35502958579882,2,0.5,62.39131328073635,66.64795964825773,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.48333339999999936,55.80000079999999,55.0,66.28138801447732,25.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,48.236624766514794,sa3023515,playerId

He missed his junior and senior high school seasons following Tommy John surgery in 2020, then lost much of his Draft year at UCLA with a back ailment and the last two months of his 2024 pro debut to a shoulder strain. Finally healthy this year, he has worked his way from Single-A to Double-A. Though Tredwell's fastball sits at a pedestrian 91-93 mph and peaks at 95, it misses bats because his 6-foot-8 frame, high arm slot and carry create deception. Both his upper-70s curveball and low-80s slider feature good depth, play well off his heater and can be solid pitches at their best. He doesn't show much faith in his mid-80s changeup with fade. Tredwell's size creates natural extension that allows his pitches to get on hitters more quickly than expected. Though he does a good job of keeping his long limbs in sync, his control has regressed from solid in college to fringy in pro ball. If he can stay healthy and improve the location of his pitches, he could be a No. 4 starter.

That was Letson, who went to the Brewers in the 11th round but signed for closer to fourth- or fifth-round money with a $482,600 bonus. The former Purdue commit spent his entire first full season with Single-A Carolina and posted a 3.13 ERA with 57 strikeouts and a .195 average-against in 63 1/3 innings. The 6-foot-4 right-hander really gets down the hill with elite extension similar to fellow Brewer Jacob Misiorowski. Letson brings a pair of fastballs to the mound with a four-seamer and sinker -- the latter showing impressive horizontal movement -- and he’ll typically sit 92-94 mph and touch 95, already showing a bump from his amateur velo. His 79-83 mph slider gets whiffs with good sweep, giving him a second above-average pitch. His 82-85 mph changeup can get some chase out of the zone but sits behind the other two in effectiveness. Letson showed more willingness to go right after hitters the more pro experience he gained, and the additional confidence may only go with added experience in year two. The Hoosier State native has the individual ingredients (size, stuff, projectability) to be a potential mid-rotation starter in Milwaukee down the line, but a shoulder issue has held him back from a bigger breakout 2025 season.

He debuted in the pros a year later with Single-A Fredericksburg and was one of the Minors’ most dominant pitchers. His 39.2 percent strikeout rate and 20.8 percent swinging-strike rate were both tops among 551 Minor Leaguers with at least 80 innings, and he also finished with a 2.33 ERA, 0.91 WHIP and .167 average-against over 85 frames in the Carolina League. Checking in at 6-foot-6, Sykora starts his delivery with a big leg kick, getting his left knee almost up to his shoulder before getting down the hill with solid extension. After throwing harder as a showcase pitcher, the right-hander settled in around the 93-96 mph range with his fastball as a professional, and there’s hope he could add another tick with more pro strength training. It was good enough to buzz past Single-A hitters in the top of the zone in 2024, and a mid-80s splitter played well off it with low spin and sufficient fade. An 83-86 mph slider also featured enough drop to generate whiffs with break the other way, and it was notable that Sykora had near-equal splits against batters from both sides. The former Texas commit walked 8.2 percent of his batters, but part of his success in that department stemmed from getting chase outside the zone. More patient upper-level hitters will test that control. Sykora was slowed out of the gate in 2025 due to offseason hip surgery but took off once he made his season debut in May. Two months later, his progress was stopped again, first by triceps soreness and then a torn UCL discovered as part of an MRI in July. After undergoing elbow reconstruction surgery, he’ll likely be off a Minor League mound until late 2026 at the earliest.

All he could do was obliterate the competition that was put in front of him, and obliterate he did with a 2.33 ERA and 39.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 85 IP at Single-A. He’s a 6’6”, 232 pound beast with 3 at least plus pitches in his mid 90’s fastball, slider and splitter. He doesn’t have pinpoint control, but he throws the ball over the plate, and he doesn’t have the most athletic looking delivery, but it’s not unathletic either. Age to level doesn’t matter nearly as much for pitchers as it does hitters, but I do think it’s still something to take into account, so him being 20 years old at Single-A makes me want to see it at higher levels before truly crowning him. Regardless, this is easy ace upside, and his hype is going to blow up in 2025. He’s the type you might want to stick your neck out to grab if he’s out there in your off-season prospect draft. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.12/225 in 185 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9833333333333333,1.0,0.675,1.0,92.22,66.66666666666667,50.0,100.0,90.92702169625247,4,1.0,75.99112426035504,86.53989349112426,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.7611111999999984,83.13333439999998,85.0,89.15296820733728,15.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,71.49550257330178,sa3023557,playerId

Selecting him in the third round (72nd pick) of the 2023 Draft, the A’s were able to snag him away from his commitment to the University of Florida with first-round money at $3 million. Getting his pro career underway last season at Single-A Stockton as an 18-year-old, he went through some ups and downs and posted a 6.55 ERA in 19 starts with 59 strikeouts and 36 walks over 57 2/3 innings. The A’s believe Echavarria’s stuff played better than the overall numbers might suggest. His fastball reached 98 mph and sat 95-96 with good ride up in the zone. The issue was struggling to command his arsenal when he would fall behind in counts. His mid-80s slider flashes plus, and his upper-80s changeup continues to improve. He also throws a two-seamer in the 92-93 mph range. He clearly dealt with some control issues, but the A’s are not at all sounding the alarm, instead patiently working with the teenager on adjustments. Echavarria profiles as a starter for the long-term with his 6-foot-1 frame and sound delivery. Previously having shown an ability to consistently throw all of his offerings for strikes prior to the Draft, he will continue to work to rediscover that control in his second season of pro ball.

When he showed increased polish on the mound as a New Jersey high school senior, teams began focusing on him as a pitcher, and the Cubs signed him for an above-slot $1 million in the fourth round. Tommy John surgery in March 2023 pushed his pro debut back to May 2024, and he has displayed some of the best stuff in the system but only sporadic control since then. Mule works at 94-96 mph and touches 98 with modest armside run on his fastball, which can straighten out at times and doesn't miss as many bats as his velocity indicates he should. His sharp mid-80s slider features more depth than sweep and can be a wipeout pitch at its best. He's in the early stages of developing a changeup, but it's too firm and has only sporadic fade. Mule has one of the more electric arms in the system but will need plenty of time to develop. He issued 42 walks in his 52-inning debut and doesn't get many chases because he often misses the strike zone by a wide margin. Chicago will give him every chance to develop as a starter, but he might be more of a two-pitch reliever.

They went almost three times over slot in the fourth round to sign Schoenwetter away from his commitment to his hometown Santa Barbara Gauchos. It took a while for the Reds to see what they had on their hands as he headed straight into rehab mode in order to build shoulder strength after the Draft, eventually making his debut in the Arizona Complex League. Numbers aside, the Reds were thrilled he was able to make 18 healthy appearances and spend some time with full-season Daytona at the end of the year. This will be the first year Schoenwetter should be able to show if he can start reaching his potential. He does have three excellent pitches in his arsenal, with a fastball that sat 92-95 mph last year, playing up with good spin rates up in the zone. He has more of a true, hard power curve, thrown anywhere in the 78-84 mph range with good depth, and his 84-87 mph changeup features good fade and he sells it well with arm speed. All three offerings might grade out as average right now, but all three could be plus in time as he physically matures and gets more reps. He struggled a bit finding the zone during his debut, but that might have been the time away from competition as much as it was anything with his delivery, which does have a little effort to it at times. He still has the chance to develop into a mid-rotation starter.

Houck went on to college before embarking on his pro career, but the Pirates stepped in with an over-slot bonus in Competitive Balance Round B of the 2023 Draft to lure Mueth away from heading to Mississippi. The Pirates often start their high school arms slowly, with time in the complex league in their first full season, and Mueth made a very strong first impression there, pitching his way to full-season Bradenton before the end of the summer. With a low three-quarters arm slot, Mueth’s stuff offers a ton of movement and deception. His fastball sat around 94 mph and was up to 97. It’s a four-seamer, but has two-seam characteristics, often with 8-9 inches of vertical break, along with up to 20 inches of horizontal. HIs mid-80s slider has a chance to be a true out pitch, a gyro-like breaker that misses a ton of bats, and his mid-80s changeup has a chance to be a solid third pitch with sink. There will be work ahead to add more depth on his slider and to make sure the changeup remains a viable option against left-handed hitters, but the biggest step Mueth needs to take in his development to remain a starter is to land his stuff in the strike zone more consistently. All of it moves so much that it will take time for him to harness it, but the Pirates are excited to see how he builds off his strong 2024 campaign.

He put up a 2.31 ERA with a 23.8/15.1 K%/BB% in 74 IP split between rookie and Single-A. The 93.8 MPH sinker keeps the ball on the ground and the slider is a potentially plus bat missing weapon. The control/command was much worse than hoped though, and he needs to develop the changeup more as well. He needs to take steps forward in 2025 to remain on this list, because 2024 was pretty unexciting. – ETA: 2028 Prime Projection: 8/4.27/1.32/133 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1515151515151515,0.696969696969697,0.1515151515151515,0.2727272727272727,32.32,50.0,,,2.3668639053254448,2,0.5,18.881903353057197,27.61666617357002,0.65,2–4 yr,-1.4111112000000006,66.9333344,46.25,36.10100001207101,33.75,0.4917499999999998,Mixed,33.819616885431955,sa3023569,playerId

The Dodgers, who signed the first Korean big leaguer (Chan Ho Park) in 1994, traded righty pitching prospects Aldrin Batista and Maximo Martinez to the White Sox for $1 million in international bonus pool funds, then landed Jang for $900,000. He posted a 6.14 ERA in his pro debut but lowered that mark to 1.47 in his final seven starts between the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League and Single-A. Jang struck out 41 percent of the batters he faced in his first taste of pro ball while displaying some of the best stuff in the system. He works with a 94-96 mph fastball that reaches 99 with good carry up in the strike zone, and he might have more velocity in his strong but still projectable 6-foot-4 frame. His tight mid-80s slider gives him a second plus pitch and he emphasized it last summer over his upper-70s downer curveball. His upper-80s changeup has been better than anticipated, featuring deceptive tumble. After a history of throwing strikes as an amateur, Jang issued 27 walks in 36 2/3 innings last year with a delivery that includes some effort and head whack. The Dodgers believe his issues were related more to targeting than mechanics and think his athleticism will help him improve in the future. He's a potential No. 2 starter if he can refine his control and command.

If he has literally a few good outings to start the season, maybe even just one good outing, the hype is going to hit really damn hard. He was one of my top FYPD pitching targets last off-season, and while his control/command was too raw to say he was a major hit, he more than showed the upside that I just can’t resist. He put up a ridiculous 41% K% in 36.2 IP split between rookie ball (41.5%) and Single-A (39.6%). He’s 6’4”, 200 pounds with an athletic righty delivery that fires a mid 90’s fastball that can reach the upper 90’s, to go along with a 2 potentially plus breakers (slider, curve), and a developing changeup that flashes plus. He was improving as the year progressed with a 2.19 ERA in 12.1 IP at Single-A (6.14 ERA on the season), which is a good sign, but the 16.3% BB% remained high all year, and that is just way too high. He has the type of stuff that can thrive with below average control, but he has work to do to get to even that. The way I see it, the raw control gives you one more off-season to get in for cheap or possibly nothing before he really starts to pop. Last year was his first year in a new country and his first year in pro ball. There was a lot of adjusting to do, and I think he’s going to look a lot more comfortable in year 2. He’s a major target.

After dealing with a back strain during his first fall as a pro and then lingering shoulder tendinitis in the spring, Wyatt made his debut later in ‘24, appearing in 12 games in Rookie ball before finishing the season at Single-A Columbia, where he posted a 2.67 ERA across six starts, with a 23.6% strikeout rate, a 9.5% walk rate and a 1.37 WHIP. Wyatt is tall and lean with projection in his body as a young pitcher. His above-average four-seam fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s with good life. He threw a little harder in high school, but there’s a chance for more velocity as he matures and gets used to the routine and schedule of pro ball. His 82-84 mph slider is plus with sweeping action that gets a good amount of chase. Wyatt is developing a changeup which sits 83-85 mph and has a chance to be average, and he also has a cutter in his back pocket that he might develop as a pitch he can throw for strikes and use against lefties. He releases from a low three-quarters slot and usually throws strikes. Like many high school pitchers out of the Draft, there’s no rush for Wyatt’s development, and the Royals are pleased with how he finished last year. There’s a lot to dream on with him, and they’ll continue to develop him as a starter. Wyatt will likely return to Columbia to begin ‘25 but could make his way to High-A by the end of the year.

In 2023, his hometown team drafted him in the fifth round and signed him away from a Florida State commitment for $847,500. Harrison, a high school teammate of Phillies prospect Aidan Miller at Mitchell High, didn’t make his professional debut until last year, but he showed a tremendous amount of potential and a surprising amount of polish for such a young pitcher. Harrison pitched well in the Florida Complex League to begin his first partial season, recording a 3.58 ERA with 39 strikeouts in 32 2/3 innings. And he finished just as strong, putting together a 3.15 ERA with 48 strikeouts in 40 innings during Single-A Charleston’s postseason push. By some evaluations, the 18-year-old Harrison was the best playoff starter in a rotation that also included Santiago Suarez and Gary Gill Hill. The 6-foot-4 right-hander’s fastball sat at 94-96 mph in the postseason series and touched 98. His heater averaged 95 mph on the season, and he throws it with impressive life up in the zone. His changeup is already a solid offering and could improve further as a weapon against left-handed hitters. His slider was also an effective secondary pitch, although he did most of his work with his heater. The Rays have credited Harrison for being fearless on the mound and attacking hitters, displaying confidence beyond his years. He’ll need to keep his control in check, as his walk rate ticked up against tougher competition in Single-A, but he has the ability to climb as high as any pitcher in the Rays’ pipeline.

The Cubs selected him in the supplemental second round in 2023 and signed him for a well-over-slot $1,401,500. He returned to the mound last year and reached High-A in his pro debut, and he has emerged as the system's best pitching prospect in 2025. Wiggins can sit at 96-97 mph deep into games and reach triple digits with his fastball, which features tough carry and armside run at times but can straighten out at others. He also can make hitters look bad with a mid-80s slider with two-plane break, though it has so much depth that it can be tough to land in the zone at times. His mid-80s changeup can miss bats with tumble at its best and has been more reliable this year. Wiggins is athletic and doesn't have any red flags in his delivery, yet he battled the strike zone throughout his college career and in his first year as a pro. His control and command have been better than ever in 2025, though they still need more refinement. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and has improved his chances of reaching it.

He broke into pro ball by logging a 0.40 ERA with 40 strikeouts in 22 1/3 innings in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League, then came to the United States and made one scoreless start in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League before thriving in Single-A. His combined 39 percent strikeout rate ranked fifth among all Minor League pitchers (minimum: 50 innings). Brito dealt with a stress reaction in his right shoulder that limited him to 49 1/3 innings at High-A during the 2025 regular season, but he dominated a pitching-starved Arizona Fall League, fanning 22 of the 47 batters he faced. The Rays acquired him from the Astros as part of a three-team deal in December. Brito gained about 5 mph of fastball velocity in his first year as a pro, working in the mid-90s and touching 99 mph with good carry up in the zone. His low-80s slider has huge horizontal action and projects as a second plus offering, and he also can spin a mid-80s curveball with promising depth. He has some feel for an upper-80s changeup with some depth that still needs a lot of refinement. The athletic Brito repeats his simple delivery with ease and threw consistent strikes before tiring toward the end of his pro debut. Only slightly bigger than his listed 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, he lacks physicality and will have to prove he can hold up and maintain his stuff over a full season's workload of starts. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and could become a high-leverage reliever if durability continues to be an issue.

The Rangers loved his athleticism, projectability and delivery metrics enough to draft him in 2023’s sixth round and sign him away from a Dallas Baptist commitment for an over-slot $515,000. A strained lat delayed his pro debut until last July and limited him to 10 1/3 innings in 2024. Very much a work in progress, Scarborough can touch 96 mph with his fastball in the first inning and then top out at 93 in the second. If he adds velocity as expected once he fills out his lanky 6-foot-5 frame, he could have a special heater because his mechanics create a great deal of carry and armside run. He entered pro ball with a soft mid-70s curveball that needs more power, and Texas had him focus instead on a low-80s slider last summer. Scarborough’s effortless delivery creates a flat approach angle and elite extension.
