The right-hander opened 2025 with Double-A San Antonio, moved up to Triple-A El Paso in June and got his first long-awaited taste of the Majors one month later just after he turned 26 years old before being included in the prospect package the A’s received from the Padres in return for Mason Miller and JP Sears at the Trade Deadline. Pitching exclusively out of the stretch, Núñez has the goal to blow both of his pitches past batters, starting with a 97-99 mph heater that has touched as high as 101.4 mph in front of Statcast this season. It’s pure velo over movement here, and Núñez gets minimal extension under six feet (allowing batters to see the fastball a little longer), but it’s still enough to make for an uncomfortable at-bat. The Dominican Republic native’s upper-80s slider is an even better pitch, getting good depth while still being thrown hard, and it’s posted whiff and chase rates above 40 percent in the Minors during Núñez’s time in the San Diego system. Plenty of left-handed hitters have been fooled by the breaking ball too, but without a quality changeup, Núñez has drastic handedness splits. Núñez’s desire to show explosive stuff can lead to inconsistencies in his delivery, and while his control numbers were much-improved with the Padres, he’s still likely to have issues locating routinely in the Majors.

He put up a 4.89 ERA (3.83 xERA) with a 27.0/9.2 K%/BB% in 38.2 IP. The 92.2 MPH fastball got hit hard, but it was able to miss bats with a 22% whiff%. The changeup was straight elite with a .207 xwOBA and 43.7% whiff%. The lesser used curve and slider also performed real well with above average xwOBA’s and bat missing ability. It led to a 31.1% whiff% overall, which is elite for a starter. The fastball is below average and the control is below average, which is why I’ve been hesitant to buy in, but proving he can miss that many bats on the MLB level is exciting. He doesn’t seem to have a rotation spot at the moment, but he can certainly win one, and I’m sure he’ll get plenty of innings regardless. I didn’t think I was going to like Cantillo a ton coming into this blurb, but I’m digging him. – 2025 Projection: 6/4.18/1.33/103 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.78/1.29/164 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7254901960784313,0.7450980392156863,0.3594771241830066,0.6143790849673203,63.11,,30.76923076923077,,75.45271629778671,2,0.5,48.3094077284218,57.92979270494763,0.875,MLB,-1.7138889000000006,70.56666680000001,51.875,62.67443783148429,28.125,0.5749999999999998,Mixed,48.47308038416793,23335,playerId

He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2022, and when he returned in 2023, his stuff looked electric in 52.2 IP. He again looked electric in the first half of 2024 with a 2.84 ERA and 25.8/4.0 K%/BB% in 73 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. But the elbow problems returned after his July 6th start, hitting the IL until August 30th. His stuff was way down in that one outing and then he hit the IL again with “a recurrent right forearm injury.” As much as I love the mid to upper 90’s fastball, the plus to double plus slider, plus control, size (6’5”), and pitch mix (he also throws a good changeup and curve), I can’t ignore the very major injury risk. It could end up landing him in the bullpen eventually, or very early into 2025 if he has problems ramping up. If I were to ignore the injury risk, I can see ranking him much higher than this, so this placement factors in a healthy dose of risk. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.10/1.28/45 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/3.72/1.17/130 in 130 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.738562091503268,0.43137254901960786,0.7189542483660131,0.5490196078431373,61.73,,,,77.66599597585513,1,0.25,60.191146881287715,61.1914014084507,1.0,MLB,-1.5111111999999984,68.13333439999998,40.0,62.52892058253521,30.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,45.26468114214084,23793,playerId

Ever since, it’s been steady progress for the now-23-year-old who spent most of the 2024 season at Double-A before making one Triple-A start. Avila posted a 1.37 WHIP over 19 starts for Northwest Arkansas. It was the first time since 2022 that he didn’t throw over 100 innings, as he missed about six weeks with a minor oblique injury. In five games (three starts) in the Arizona Fall League, Avila posted a 3.07 ERA with 17 strikeouts and eight walks in 14 2/3 innings. The Royals added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft in November. Last year marked the first time Avila missed significant time; he’s been a durable young pitcher for the Royals, and those innings don’t go unnoticed. Avila's comfort zone with his fastball is 94-95 mph with flashes of the upper 90s, and the pitch has natural cut and ride. To help him command the armside of the plate, Avila introduced a two-seamer that is about the same velo as his four-seamer. His 80-82 mph curveball has become a true weapon with high spin and impressive depth; he's gone to it more in 2025 than his four-seamer. A fringe-average changeup rounds out Avila’s arsenal, a pitch he’s still developing with a focus on backing off the 89-91 mph velocity. Avila has near-average command but hides the ball well in his delivery, and as he’s grown, his presence on the mound has gotten stronger. Now that he’s on the 40-man, Avila could make his big league debut at some point in 2025. He needs more development time in Omaha, particularly with his changeup and command, but will be part of the Triple-A depth after dealing with a right shoulder impingement earlier in the summer. Avila will continue to start but might be someone whom the Royals can rely on in different roles depending on need for a long reliever or a swingman.

He put up a 4.06 ERA with a 26.6/8.9 K%/BB% in 37.2 IP at Triple-A. All 4 of his pitches were absolute whiff machines with the 94.4 MPH fastball putting up a decent 21.9% whiff%, the changeup putting up a 49% whiff%, the slider notching a 37.9% whiff%, and the curve putting up a 35.3% whiff%. That is damn impressive. He’s also generally had solid control throughout his career. It’s probably #4 starter upside, but there are jobs to be won in Pitt’s rotation, and I like his profile. He’s a deep league target. – 2025 Projection: 4.35/1.35/83 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.02/1.29/140 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.49673202614379086,0.7581699346405228,0.5947712418300654,0.7320261437908496,63.04,,,,45.27162977867203,1,0.25,35.08551307847082,53.255929577464784,0.9275,MLB,-1.6027777999999984,69.23333359999998,38.1875,61.03377891323943,31.8125,0.5770999999999998,Mixed,44.17749223095774,24728,playerId

He’s expected to be out until mid-season 2025, and it sure seems like he has a lot to come back from. I get writing him off until he proves he is healthy, as he was never a hyped pitching prospect either. But it’s hard to write him off when you remember how good he was in his 2023 MLB debut. He put up a 2.70 ERA with a 31.7/9.8 K%/BB% in 20 IP. His 35.0% whiff%, even in a small sample, is very impressive. His slider and changeup were untouchable and the 93.6 MPH 4-seamer and 92.4 MPH sinker performed well too. If he does get healthy, and if he can pick up from 2023, he definitely has impact fantasy starter upside. At this point in the rankings, I think it’s worth hanging onto him. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.33/38 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.82/1.24/152 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8366013071895425,0.48366013071895425,0.9215686274509804,0.738562091503268,74.11,,,,60.56338028169015,1,0.25,46.93661971830986,64.59931690140846,0.9800000000000001,MLB,0.30277770000000004,46.3666676,39.5,67.09529521042253,33.527777,0.6385999999999998,Mixed,42.33704981469015,26048,playerId

The Rangers loved the athleticism and upside he showed in sporadic mound appearances as a senior to pay him an over-slot $300,000 bonus as an 18th-rounder in 2019. He has struck out one-third of the hitters he faced in pro ball and made his big league debut with a scoreless inning last September after missing the bulk of the 2024 season with a strained rotator cuff. Church can make hitters look silly with three different pitches, the most devasting of which is a mid-80s slider with two-plane depth at its best. It pairs extremely well with a fastball that sits at 95-97 mph and maxes out at 99 with tremendous carry, though it can straighten out at times. In the Arizona Fall League last offseason, he unveiled a nasty 89-93 mph splitter that dove at the plate. Church is athletic and explodes down the mound to create good extension in his delivery, which features some effort. He has closer upside but will have to throw more strikes after his walk rate jumped from 7 percent in Class A to 12 percent in Double-A and Triple-A.

The two gentlemen of Verona soon parted ways, with Mattia setting up shop in the Italian professional league and Samuel signing with the Phillies in July 2019 for $100,000. He didn’t make his pro debut until 2021 and missed most of '22 with a shoulder issue. Things started to click a bit in 2023 then really took off last year, when he reached Double-A for the first time, got traded along with George Klassen in the Carlos Estévez deal and made his big league debut with the Angels. In many ways, Aldegheri is the anti-Klassen, the pitchability lefty vs. the flame-thrower. But he does have a legitimate four-pitch mix and a very good idea of what to do with it. His fastball sits around 92-93 mph and can touch 95-96, and it has decent spin and carry up in the zone. All three of his secondary offerings have bat-missing potential, led by an 84 mph slider that was his go-to breaker. His low-80s changeup has improved to the point that it might be better than the breaking stuff, and he throws a 76 mph curve as well. Combined, they elicited a 44 percent miss rate in 2024, according to Synergy. Aldegheri does an excellent job mixing his pitches and keeping hitters guessing and off balance. While his walk rate hasn’t been akin to a “pitchability” guy, he’s around the zone a lot and there’s better command to come for the southpaw. He’ll be just 23 for most of the 2025 season and it’s looking more and more like he’ll fit into a big league rotation soon.

The fastball only sits 92.2 MPH, but it put up a 19.4% whiff% in the majors, which really isn’t all that bad considering he was a 22 year old who jumped straight to the majors from Double-A. That tells me the low 90’s fastball can definitely play, and he combines that with a plus slider that actually ate up MLB hitters, putting up a .091 xwOBA with a 38.5% whiff%. He also mixed in a below average changeup and below average curve. He wasn’t good in the majors with a 4.85 ERA and 14.9/14.9 K%/BB% in 13 IP, but I’m actually impressed with the fastball/slider combo and pitch mix. He was also a K machine in the minors with a 3.59 ERA and 33.5/10.3 K%/BB% in 95.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. His K rate didn’t dip in the upper minors, which is a big step. If he didn’t have below average control, I might be willing to get really excited for him, but with below average control, I’m leaning a #4 as his reasonable upside. Improving his control, or his third pitch, or his velocity could easily take him up a notch. He’s growing on me. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/79 in 85 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.32/151 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,fuzzy,96,0.4509803921568627,0.06535947712418301,0.4509803921568627,0.1503267973856209,29.37,58.62068965517242,33.333333333333336,74.4186046511628,40.845070422535215,4,1.0,48.44707109268818,36.046974882440864,1.0,MLB,-3.4388888999999985,91.26666679999998,85.0,40.657592484732255,15.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,51.29924997812951,26443,playerId

His progress was delayed by persistent hamstring troubles in 2023 and a groin injury in 2024, and he has totaled just 312 innings in his first six years as a pro. He made his big league debut on the final day of last season, spinning three shutout frames against the Cardinals. McDonald ran his four-seam fastball up to 98 mph in 2023 but has focused more on his two-seamer since, operating at 91-94 and touching 96 with more sink but inconsistent success. His mid-80s slider moves in the opposite direction with above-average horizontal action and depth, and it can be a plus pitch at its best. His mid-80s changeup is a bit firm but effective with life that mimic his sinker's. McDonald's low three-quarters slot and short arm action produce significant horizontal action on his two-seamer, slider and changeup. It's not a traditional delivery but he has learned to repeat it well and provide consistent strikes. If he can refine his command further and stay healthy, he could become a back-of-the-rotation starter.

After the White Sox acquired him in a three-prospect package for Dylan Cease in March 2024, he ranked third in the Double-A Southern League in opponent average (.228) and WHIP (1.28) and fourth in ERA (3.71) and strikeouts (122 in 126 innings). He posted a 1.50 ERA in six relief appearances with Chicago at the end of the season. After parking in the mid-90s and peaking at 100 mph in the first half of 2023, Iriarte's fastball has settled in at 92-94 mph with a high of 96, and its excessive armside run now stands out more than its velocity. His sharp 82-85 mph slider has good horizontal action in the opposite direction and plays well off his heater. So does his upper-80s changeup with fade, giving him a third solid offering. While Iriarte wasn't as overpowering as the year before he did throw more strikes, though his control and command still need more work. He's athletic and creates plenty of extension with his delivery, adding to his deception. He could be a No. 3 starter if he improves his location, perhaps more if he recaptures some velocity, but he also could wind up as a late-inning reliever.

He put up a 3.71 ERA with a 22.8/10.7 K%/BB% in 126 IP. The stuff backed up a tick or two, and the performance backed up with it. The fastball sits about 94 MPH and it wasn’t able to miss many bats. It put up a 4.8% whiff% in his 6 IP MLB debut. The slider misses bats (47.1% whiff% in that small MLB sample), and he throws a lesser used changeup which can be an average pitch. Chicago’s rotation is horrific, so they have every reason to stick with Iriarte in the rotation, but it’s not a special profile. It’s a back end profile with mid-rotation upside, which can say about tons of pitching prospects. And it might be a bullpen profile on a team who had a real rotation. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.54/1.41/82 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.24/1.33/135 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.05228758169934644,0.13725490196078433,0.05228758169934644,0.032679738562091505,7.26,44.827586206896555,,,33.601609657947684,2,0.5,32.53723490367492,16.10703221628622,1.0,MLB,-3.7055556000000003,94.4666672,55.0,22.995109744885866,25.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,36.49113282519865,26907,playerId

A year after singing Roddery, the Braves added his twin brother, Rolddy, for just $20,000. It took a while for Rolddy to gain any real traction in the system, spending three seasons in Single- or High-A. He had a little more success in 2023 with High-A Rome, then pitched his way from Rome to Double-A Mississippi, having enough success at the upper level for the Braves to add him to the 40-man roster. Munoz is a 6-foot-2 right-handed reliever only with a very impressive two-pitch power repertoire. He throws both a four- and two-seam fastball at the same velocity, averaging 97-98 mph in 2024 and touching triple digits. While it can get hit at times, his two-seamer has good sink and helps get groundball outs. His 88-91 mph slider plays really well, eliciting a miss rate north of 52 percent last year. One thing that had held Munoz back previously was his inability to throw enough strikes and not always commanding the ball well within the zone when he found it. He’s cut his hit rate down the last two seasons and limited his walks more in 2024. If that continues, his stuff could be effective in high-leverage situations in the big leagues soon.

He barely made it back on a minor league mound with 8.1 IP at High-A and rookie ball after getting shutdown with a “dead arm.” It’s just a reminder that coming back from Tommy John surgery is not always smooth, and while it’s not a death knell by any means, it’s not always a cake walk right back into prime form. Here is how I finished his blurb in last year’s Top 1,000, and honestly, it’s still exactly how I feel now: “When healthy, the 6’4”, 240 pound Cavalli does have plenty to be excited about with big time stuff (95+ MPH fastball) and three quality secondaries in his curve, changeup and slider. The control is inconsistent and his minor league career was a bit up and down, so combined with the Tommy John risk, he’s not someone I’m really targeting.” The one thing he does have going for him is that there is plenty of opportunity in Washington’s rotation, so the leash should be very long for him to shake the rust off. – 2025 Projection: 4/4.38/1.37/94 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 9/4.03/1.32/162 in 159 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6274509803921569,0.39869281045751637,0.5816993464052287,0.45751633986928103,52.54,,,,65.79476861167002,1,0.25,50.99094567404426,51.9978309859155,1.0,MLB,-0.3694445000000002,54.433334,40.0,52.66134939577465,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,38.08427402809859,27473,playerId

He put up a 2.35 ERA with a 28.1/7.1 K%/BB% in 145.1 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A (he dominated both levels equally). The fastball only sits 90.7 MPH, but it put up a 32.4% whiff% at Triple-A, and the changeup is at least plus with a 45% whiff%. The cutter and slider are useful pitches too which can induce weak contact. The control is solid, but it’s been below average at points in his career, and you probably really have to count on plus control to maximize this profile. – 2025 Projection: Prime Projection: 10/4.19/130/149 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6339869281045751,0.673202614379085,0.9150326797385621,0.8366013071895425,74.11,,,,2.6156941649899346,1,0.25,2.027162977867199,48.88100704225352,1.0,MLB,-0.6999999999999993,58.39999999999999,40.0,64.18480211267605,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,44.06316095070422,27932,playerId

He was added to the 40-man roster that offseason and then traded to the D-backs for outfielder Dominic Fletcher. Playing in his first season in the Arizona system, Mena finished with a 4.61 ERA, 102 strikeouts and 46 walks in 95 2/3 innings for Triple-A Reno and got a cup of coffee and the start for his Major League debut on July 3. He didn’t pitch again after July 25 due to a right forearm strain but is considered good to go for 2025. The youngest pitcher to throw more than 90 frames at Triple-A last season, Mena should be graded on somewhat of a curve, and he showed up to camp with good added weight and strength. That’s promising because he already added velocity in 2024 and was showing a four-seamer and a sinker around 92-94 mph. His velo has been up another tick in 2025. Both pitches were extremely hittable without stellar movement in Triple-A, though, and Mena needed to rely more on his mid-80s breaking pitches to get whiffs. His curveball drops sharply downward while his slider shows decent sweep but can bleed into the curve. Mena lands both well out of a high three-quarters slot, and batters have trouble reading it out of his hand. The curve has become the better of the two and has been used almost like a primary pitch in '25. An 89-91 mph changeup gave him an armside offspeed option but doesn't have much separation at all. Mena doesn’t look like he’s overthrowing out of an athletic delivery, but because he’s so reliant on breaking pitches, he can run into control issues if hitters don’t chase them outside the zone. His age means he should still have a long leash as a starter, and improving fastball quality would be a big help.

Traded to the Rangers along with infield prospect Andres Mesa in exchange for Rafael Montero in December 2020, he compiled a 6.02 ERA in his first two pro seasons before winning Texas' Minor League pitcher of the year award in 2023. Some evaluators thought he was the best starting pitching prospect in the system before his elbow gave out in 2024, requiring Tommy John surgery in July that sidelined him for all of last season and will cost him much of this one. Corniell throws three different versions of a fastball: a 92-95 mph four-seamer that reaches 97 with armside run and carry, a low-90s two-seamer that sinks and induces grounders and an upper-80s cutter he picked up in 2023 to use against left-handed hitters. His best offering is a sweeping 82-85 mph slider with two-plane depth at its best. He had made progress with a low-80s changeup that tumbles. Employing a drop-and-drive delivery, Corniell creates extension and a flat approach angle that add deception to his pitches. He has a strong 6-foot-3 frame and a quick arm, though some scouts think his arm action is more conducive to relieving than starting.

He made 21 appearances in the winter league back home ahead of ’24, and that helped set the 6-foot-1 right-hander set off on a massive breakout campaign. Pitching exclusively in relief, Rodriguez posted a 2.64 ERA and .180 average-against with 75 strikeouts in 61 1/3 innings across three levels, topping out at Double-A San Antonio. Pitch for pitch, Rodriguez may have the most dynamic stuff in the entire San Diego system. Pitching in shorter stints, he touched 101 mph in 2024 and sat 96-99 with his fastball, and low-level batters just couldn’t handle that level of heat, particularly when he ran it up the ladder to the top of the zone. His changeup was arguably even better -- an 86-89 mph offering with the right amount of separation and tunneling leading to a 58.2 percent whiff rate in ’24. His hard upper-80s slider was an option saved for righties and flashes above average. It's certainly an effortful delivery from the righty to get to those upper-level velocities, and it didn’t come as a shock that his control wavered as he climbed the ladder in 2024. There is a certain temptation to see how he would look as a starter, considering Rodriguez will still only be 21 for the entire ’25 campaign, but the stuff plays so well in relief now, it might be best to let him be. He’s already a quick climber in the traditional Padres prospect mold and could impact the San Diego bullpen soon.

He put up a 3.80 ERA with a 32.1/10.8 K%/BB% in 104.1 IP in the upper minors. He then got a shot in the majors, and while the 16% K% in 28.1 IP isn’t impressive, his slider (36.5% whiff%) and curve (35.3% whiff%) were both whiff machines, so he clearly has more in the tank. He also throws gas with a 96.1 MPH fastball, although it wasn’t a very good pitch in the majors. He threw the fastball more than 50% of the time, and combined with the below average control and lack of rotation spot, there are enough seasons to doubt him to not get too carried away here. But velocity, swing and miss secondaries, and upper minors production is a strong trifecta, so if he works his way into a rotation spot, I’d be happy to roster him to see how it plays out. 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.35/66 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.31/151 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.006535947712418277,0.3137254901960784,0.0,0.013071895424836602,9.15,,,,67.40442655935614,1,0.25,52.238430583501,24.23095070422535,1.0,MLB,-2.3833334000000015,78.60000080000002,40.0,24.09178533126761,30.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,30.06130355907043,29271,playerId

He led the Minors with 338 strikeouts between the 2022 and 2023 seasons and spent the entire latter campaign with Triple-A Nashville. After a brief return to the International League in the spring of 2024, the southpaw made five solid starts for the Major League club in which he lasted at least five frames in each appearance. He reported elbow issues after a June 1 outing and after a series of opinions, eventually underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery. Before the procedure, the 6-foot left-hander showed off a pair of 91-94 mph fastballs with a four-seamer and a sinker, the latter of which averaged nearly 16 inches of armside run in the bigs. His 79-82 mph slider was actually his most oft-used single pitch in the Majors, a real sweeping option that almost mirrors the horizontal movement of the sinker and befuddled both righties and lefties alike. A changeup and cutter -- both in the upper-80s -- round out the arsenal as options against righties, with the latter acting more like a bullet for anyone sitting on the spin of the slider. Gasser walked only one of the 114 Major League batters he faced, but he’s shown closer to average control throughout his pro career. His command will be worth monitoring as he continues to his return to pitching in the second half of 2025. It still might not be until 2026 that Gasser factors back into Milwaukee’s rotation.

The 21.6% whiff% was better than the K rate, and his most used pitch, the sweeper, had a strong 34.5% whiff%. He missed plenty of bats in the minors, so the K rate (and walk rate) should have normalized over time, but he didn’t have time. He injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery in June 2024 which will knock him out for most or all of 2025. He doesn’t have the upside I look for when taking the TJ discount, so he’s not a target for me, but he was looking like another underrated Brewers success story before going down with the injury. – 2025 Projection: OUT Prime Projection: 9/4.08/1.30/140 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7908496732026143,0.5751633986928104,0.7777777777777778,0.7058823529411765,71.39,26.923076923076927,,,40.241448692152915,2,0.5,29.488308053448897,56.724407818707114,0.95,MLB,-1.1638889,63.9666668,53.75,65.87682236561214,26.25,0.6364999999999998,Mixed,49.250403424525466,29812,playerId

The stuff is quite good with a bat missing 93.7 MPH fastball, 3 plus, bat missing secondaries (slider, changeup, sweeper) and a solid curve too. It resulted in a 3.78 ERA with a 32.9% K%. Pitchers are notorious for having something click later in their career, so even at 26 years old, I don’t think that is too old for a breakout considering the talent is still in here. One other complicating factor is that he went down with a shoulder injury after his July 30th start. He returned for one start at the end of the season where the velocity was down 2 ticks. He was probably just taking it easy, but it does tack on extra risk heading into the off-season. Baltimore has tons of opportunity is their rotation right now, so they have every reason to keep McDermott a starter for as long as possible, and he has the fantasy friendly upside to roster as a proximity arm in medium to deeper leagues. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.35/90 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.31/172 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.0980392156862745,0.2973856209150327,0.065359477124183,0.05228758169934641,13.85,,,,40.643863179074444,1,0.25,31.49899396378269,20.02714788732394,1.0,MLB,-0.39166669999999826,54.70000039999998,40.0,21.83064442619718,30.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,24.263790071788726,29866,playerId

After hitting and pitching for a season, Chandler put the bat away for good and has developed into one of the best pitching prospects in baseball, reaching Triple-A in 2024 and serving notice that he's ready to contribute to a big league rotation. Chandler has rapidly evolved from an athlete and thrower to a complete pitcher with a real idea of how to use all four of his pitches effectively. It still starts with his elite-level fastball that averaged 96.7 mph and touched 99 in 2024, according to Synergy. It has impressive vertical break, his command of the pitch has improved and he holds the premium velocity deep into starts. The Pirates challenged Chandler to focus on the development of his secondary offerings, and he responded with a much-improved 86-87 mph slider and upper-80s changeup while still dropping in the occasional low-80s curve. The athletic right-hander showed that he's learned not to lean solely on his heater by throwing slider-changeup-slider to start out the first batter he faced in Triple-A. His strike-throwing continues to improve, and he has the chance to eventually have three plus pitches he can land in the zone. Honing his craft while working out with Paul Skenes, Jared Jones and fellow prospect Thomas Harrington will only help him reach his considerable ceiling.

Chandler most certainly fell into the pure stuff first category with his upside being obvious, but he had a lot of refinement needed with a 4.75 ERA and 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% 106 IP at High-A in 2023. And that refinement smacked upper minors hitters right in the face in 2024 with him exploding. He put up a 3.08 ERA with a 30.9/8.6 K%/BB% in 119.2 IP. He was even better at Triple-A than he was at Double-A. The fastball sits 96.8 MPH and notched a 30.5% whiff% at Triple-A. The changeup is his best secondary with a 83.6 MPH EV against and 41.2% whiff%. The slider is above average with a 85 MPH EV against and 29.4% whiff%. And the lesser used curve was a good pitch too. He also most certainly looks the part at a built up and athletic 6’2”. There is zero doubt that this is an elite pitching prospect with ace upside. He’s not a completely finished product and he needs to continue to improve his command and refine his pitches, but he’s shown he’s more than capable of making those improvements in 2024. He could crack the Pirates rotation out of camp, and even if he doesn’t, it won’t be long before he gets the call.

It’s a back end profile, but I can’t ignore his MLB debut. He put up a 1.96 ERA with a 20.9/2.3 K%?BB% in 23 IP. His slider put up a very good 34.5% whiff%, the 92.9 MPH fastball put up an elite 30% whiff% the cutter was an excellent pitch with a .208 xwOBA, his sinker put up a negative 8 degree launch, and his much lesser used curve put up a 50% whiff%. Those pitches didn’t perform as well at Triple-A as they did in the majors, so there is definitely some small sample stuff going on, but at the least, the pro debut proved his profile will transfer.

He had his 2nd strong MLB outing in a row, going 5 IP with 5 hits, 2 ER, and a 5/2 K/BB vs. Oakland. The fastball sat 95.4 MPH and put up a 29% whiff%, while the slider and curve were solid as well with a 33% and 30% whiff%. It led to a 31% whiff% overall. His first outing against Cleveland was more of the same, and he now has a 2.25 ERA with a 30.4% whiff% in 8 IP. He has size (6’6”, 230 pounds), velocity (mid 90’s heat that misses bats) and bat missing secondaries (slider, curve change). He didn’t perform well at Triple-A with a 4.62 ERA in 64.1 IP, but all 4 of his pitches missed a ton of bats leading to a 31% K%. Control is the biggest problem here with well below average walk rates his entire career, but super tall pitchers can sometimes take longer to make control gains, and we all know that pitching development isn’t linear. So far in the majors he has a 8.3% BB%. Again, I’m not calling him a target, but I am saying there is some very interesting stuff going on here. There are definitely ingredients for a big breakout in the future, and as a free pick up in the vast majority of leagues, I don’t hate it all. Consider this your first little warning on Burke.” … and after that outing, Burke dominated in 2 more starts with 1 ER and a 14/4 K/BB in 11 IP. If he was able to do it in a larger sample, he might have been valued more closely with Spencer Arrighetti (both have similar-ish profiles), and I’m apt to use the small sample to my advantage. The skills are there are to be a high K mid-rotation starter, and he did prove it on the MLB level.

He put up a 4.86 ERA with a 28.5/11.0 K%/BB% in 87 IP at Triple-A. He might not have been the wunderkind we hoped for, but he’s still a good pitching prospect with a 95 MPH fastball that gets good movement and misses bats. The secondaries are good too with a changeup that notched a 42.3% whiff% and 84.8 MPH EV, a slider that notched a 34.8% whiff% and 86.1 MPH EV, and a decent curve that notched a 81.6 MPH EV and 23.9% whiff%. That is 3 potentially above average to plus pitches with a decent 4th pitch. Even with below average control, that profile could work as a #3/4 type starter, but what would really pull this entire thing together is a big step forward in control/command. Atlanta is also a great organization to bet on for pitching prospects. He’s more of a Top 200 guy than Top 100 one, so his value certainly took a hit, but I would try to stay strong one more year if you can. 2025 Projection: 4/4.32/1.36/83 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.95/1.31/155 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5163398692810457,0.7516339869281046,0.7091503267973855,0.7843137254901961,66.92,,,,63.581488933601605,1,0.25,49.27565392354124,60.74447887323944,0.6275000000000001,MLB,-4.636111199999998,100.0,30.6875,70.02934366197184,39.3125,0.5650999999999999,Mixed,51.75382964788733,29960,playerId

They immediately moved him to the bullpen and he has dominated ever since, ranking in the top five in strikeout rate among Minor League relievers (minimum: 50 innings) in each of his three full seasons: fifth in 2022 (40 percent), fourth in 2023 (39 percent) and fifth again last year (37 percent). Traded to the Cubs along with infielder Ben Cowles in exchange for Mark Leiter Jr. at the Trade Deadline in July 2024, he gave up six runs in six relief appearances with Chicago and has seen his stuff and control regress this year. Neely's slider can be virtually unhittable, posting elite chase (42 percent), swing-and-miss (55 percent) and swinging-strike (30 percent) rates between Double-A, Triple-A and the Majors in 2024. His slide piece averages 87 mph and reaches 91 with tight spin and two-plane depth at its best but hasn't been as sharp this season. He sets it up with a four-seam fastball that ranges from 94-98 mph and has bat-missing carry, though it's fairly straight and can get pounded when it catches too much of the plate. With his massive 6-foot-8 frame and low three-quarters arm slot, Neely creates more angle and extension than most pitchers. The Yankees helped him learn to keep his long limbs in sync and throw more consistent strikes but he has averaged nearly a walk per inning in 2025. He looked like a potential setup man when the Cubs acquired him but his future is more muddled now.

The former supplemental first-round Draft pick spent April repeating Double-A Erie with instructions to hone his newly-developed splitter. After four SeaWolves starts, Madden moved to Triple-A Toledo, where he posted a 7.97 ERA and allowed 17 homers in 79 innings but also fanned 102 batters, 11 of them over a 5 2/3-inning loss in which he gave up 12 hits. The Tigers, needing pitching, believed in the stuff over results and called him up at the end of August. Though he mainly worked out of the bullpen, his seven strikeouts over five innings of one-run ball earned him his first Major League win Sept. 8 at Oakland. He also made Detroit’s postseason bullpen. Madden’s mid-90s fastball and snappy slider form a dynamic duo that has been his weapon against hitters ever since his days as a starter at the University of Texas. His heater plays up beyond its 94 mph average with good ride, allowing it to play at the top of the strike zone and set up the slider to change eye levels. An upper-80s cutter was an effective pitch at Triple-A with mixed results in limited Major League use. Though Madden’s new splitter improved as a swing-and-miss pitch on his way up the Minors, he’s still learning when to use it and how to set it up. Madden missed more bats later in the season after lowering his arm angle a tad and changing his positioning on the mound at Toledo. The Tigers have left the door open for Madden to compete for a starting job, but Detroit’s wealth of pitching could ultimately leave the bullpen as his best route to stick in the big leagues. His ability to take constructive criticism and adapt his game impressed coaches and higher-ups last year.

The right-hander was limited by forearm, triceps and shoulder injuries, and facing his age-25 season in 2025, he moved to the bullpen with Double-A Erie. He’s flourished in that role and debuted with the Tigers’ Major League relief corps on June 2. As expected, Smith’s fastball velocity has taken a nice jump in shorter stints, moving from 92-94 as a starter in 2024 to 93-96, touching 98, as a reliever. On top of the velo, the four-seamer comes with cut-ride action to give it a boost, and Smith will mix in a sinker to present batters with another look with more armside run. The former Crimson Tide hurler’s mid-80s sweeper has become his go-to breaking ball (over his curveball) and best pitch at generating whiffs-per-swing with 9-12 inches of horizontal break. Smith also has a splitter around the same velo to kill spin and give him another option for lefties, though it lags behind the other pitches in usage. Smith’s control hasn’t suffered even as his stuff has ticked up, and he isn’t overthrowing from his high three-quarters slot to get that extra juice. The injuries were what moved him to the bullpen in the first place, and it seems like one-to-two-inning stints are the best way to keep him on the mound and harness the best version of his arsenal. He could become a key piece of A.J. Hinch’s relief plans as the Tigers head back toward the postseason.

He made his MLB debut and got absolutely shellacked, putting up a 8.83 ERA with a 17.9/9.8 K%/BB% in 35.2 IP. He also didn’t have the minor league career you would have expected from a talent like this, although he was much better in 2024 than 2023 with a 3.51 ERA and 33.3/10.6 K%/BB% in 77 IP at Triple-A. The below average control is killing him, but there is more than enough here for me to stick to my guns about staying strong. His 96.4 MPH fastball is a bat missing weapon that put up a 32.1% whiff% at AAA and a 28.9% whiff% in the majors. His slider was a whiff machine at AAA with a 43.2% whiff%, but it dropped off in the majors with a 21.8% whiff%. But on the flip side, his lesser used curve and changeup were actually pretty good in the majors. The curve put up a .212 xwOBA with a 38.7% whiff% on 11.4% usage, and the change put up a .237 xwOBA with a 35.7% whiff% on 5.8% usage. The pieces are still here to turn into an impact fantasy starter, and it seemingly should be able to work even with below average control, but so far, it just hasn’t come together. We’ve seen this story a million times from top level talents like Leiter, so while he could easily end up being a bust, I’m not writing him off to that fate yet. He’s a hold for me. – 2025 Projection: 7/4.18/1.34/127 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.74/1.26/183 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.30718954248366015,0.38562091503267976,0.39542483660130723,0.35947712418300654,35.73,,,,78.4708249496982,1,0.25,60.814889336016094,44.50971126760563,0.6275000000000001,MLB,-2.0555556000000017,74.66666720000002,30.6875,44.20441346028169,39.3125,0.5162749999999998,Mixed,35.065944497126765,30146,playerId

He was mostly a control over stuff guy coming into this year, but it sure looks like he’s changing that profile into a stuff over control guy now, and for fantasy, that is definitely what we want to see, but he still has to prove he can truly harness the stuff in a starting role. He’s so obviously a major riser this spring, and with Bello starting the year on the IL, there is a rotation spot to be won, so he makes for a great underrated target.

The Twins took that arm strength at No. 26 overall, but he wasn’t there for long. He was just getting going in his first Spring Training when he went to the Reds in the Sonny Gray deal. He’s earned a promotion in each of his three seasons of pro ball, even with a careful workload in 2023 following a minor elbow issue, and the gloves came off in 2024 as he topped 130 innings and finished with a pair of strong starts in Triple-A. Petty’s evolution and maturation from thrower to complete pitcher has continued, though he’s still throwing plenty hard enough. His fastball is almost a setup pitch to his secondary offerings, but he still averaged 95-96 mph, touching the upper 90s, and his two-seamer features good sink for groundball contact. At times he has a distinct upper-80s slider and a 91-92 mph cutter, although they occasionally run into each other. They miss bats at a high rate in any iteration. He has a firm upper-80s changeup that isn’t quite as effective, but it can kill spin and offer some sink and fade. With an athletic delivery, Petty has a strong track record of filling up the strike zone, though his walk rate did balloon in Double-A in 2024. He’s still very young for his stage of development, pitching all of 2025 at age 22, and he came to Spring Training even more physical. He’s officially in knocking on the door territory with a mid-rotation ceiling.

He worked on regaining that velocity this off-season, and it worked with him back up into the mid 90’s all season. It came at the cost of his control, and he didn’t have a particularly great year, but we are watching the development of a very talented, first round high school arm right before our eyes on the professional level. He was a freshly turned 21 in the upper minors all season and put up a 4.20 ERA with a 22.4/10.2 K%/BB% in 137 IP. He racked up innings, he maintained his stuff, and he more than held his own against much older competition. He has an excellent bat missing secondary in his slider, he has a solid change to use against lefties, and the big velocity is back. I’m sure he’s going to go back in the lab this off-season to continue to improve and work on his game. He’s not a truly coveted pitching prospect, but he’s a still a good one. – 2025 Projection: 1/4.44/1.38/38 in 45 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/174 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.1895424836601307,0.0392156862745098,0.33986928104575165,0.08496732026143791,16.38,78.57142857142857,0.0,,45.87525150905433,3,0.75,38.84912415670494,24.24419345484673,1.0,MLB,-5.0083334000000015,100.0,70.0,31.282258036454017,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,45.07701611640431,30170,playerId

He reached San Francisco for 10 appearances in 2024-25, blanking the Royals for 5 2/3 innings in September 2024 for his lone victory. Kansas City acquired him in exchange for righty pitching prospect Logan Martin after the Giants designated Black for assignment in November this year. Black throws two variations of an average fastball and the velocity on his heater dipped in 2024 and hasn't bounced back. Both his two- and four-seamers sit around 93 mph and top out at 96. Neither his low-80s sweeping slider nor his mid-80s cutter have been as effective in 2025 as they were last season, leaving him without a better than average offering. Though Black also possesses a fading upper-80s changeup, it's too firm and flat and he didn't elicit a single swing and miss with the 91 cambios he threw last season. He slings his pitches from a low three-quarters delivery with quality extension that gives him deception without costing him the ability to throw strikes. He's more of a back-of-the-rotation starter unless he regains some velocity and improves his command.

The 4.52 xERA and 26.4/9.1 K%/BB% look much better, and his pitches were missing bats. His 93.8 MPH 4-seamer actually performed excellently with a 24.6% whiff% and .255 xwOBA. His famed sweeper wasn’t great, but it still put up a 37.1% whiff%, which tells me better day are ahead, and the underlying numbers on the changeup were really good with a .221 xwOBA and 32% whiff%. Both the changeup and sweeper got massively unlucky, which was the main culprit for the ridiculous ERA. He also throws a sinker and cutter, giving him a diverse pitch mix. He wasn’t good at Triple-A either with a 5.91 ERA in 109.2 IP, but again, the 28.0/8.0 K%/BB% looked much better. He’s probably a back end starter, but I don’t think his 2024 was as bad as it seemed on the surface. Looking at the underlying metrics of the individual pitches actually paints a kinda encouraging picture. He’s only a deeper league play right now, but I would hold him in those leagues. 2025 Projection: 7/4.31/1.35/124 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.32/153 in 150 IP Update: Injuries could push him into a starting role and he’s looked good this spring",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7320261437908497,0.46405228758169936,0.7843137254901961,0.6339869281045751,65.29,,,,35.010060362173036,1,0.25,27.1327967806841,51.93497887323944,0.575,MLB,-1.2083334000000008,64.50000080000001,29.375,61.16499378197184,40.625,0.5629999999999998,Mixed,40.20549736188733,30182,playerId

It’s the plus control and plus changeup that has been befuddling upper minors hitters, and we know that profile can often stall in the majors.

He also throws a solid curve and cutter, giving him a starter’s pitch mix.

But there are a few other truly elite pitching prospects in the minors right now (Painter, Schultz, Bubba, Kumar), and Jobe’s 25.6/12.0 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP at mostly Double-A just isn’t as impressive as theirs. It came with a 2.34 ERA, and the stuff is filthy with a 97 MPH plus fastball and 3 potentially plus secondaries in his sweeper, changeup, and cutter, so he’s right there with all of them, he just doesn’t hold down the top spot right now. Or the top 2. I have him 4th behind Painter, Schultz and Bubba, but there is no shame in that game as those guys are potentially true aces, just like Jobe is. Jobe should break camp with the team in 2025, or not every long after that, and while I wouldn’t expect an ace season right out of the gate, I’m betting on him getting there eventually. – 2025 Projection: 8/3.83/1.27/136 in 140 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.31/1.08/207 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.326797385620915,0.09803921568627451,0.565359477124183,0.21568627450980393,29.77,,,,95.97585513078471,1,0.25,74.38128772635814,45.38395070422535,0.4025,MLB,-4.3305556,100.0,25.0625,44.98868521126761,44.9375,0.5140249999999998,Mixed,38.51678334507042,30203,playerId

But it might be Fuentes, who signed for just $75,000 out of Colombia in January of that year, who is the best big leaguer from the crop. He made a good first impression in the Dominican Summer League after signing but struggled in his United States debut with full-season Augusta in 2023. Repeating the level allowed Fuentes to get back on the upswing in 2024 as he led all Braves minor league arms with more than 70 innings pitched in a host of statistical categories, all as a teenager. While Fuentes isn’t the biggest guy in the world at six-foot even, he’s athletic and has the makings of a starting pitcher’s mix and the command to go with it. Not only does he throw his fastball for strikes at a 72 percent rate, he misses a lot of bats with it. It averaged 93.6 mph last year and topped out at 97 mph, playing up thanks to a low release and impressive VAA (vertical approach angle). His 84-85 mph slider is a solid breaking ball and his best secondary offering. He has a splitter as an offspeed choice but doesn’t throw it often. Athletic on the mound, Fuentes has shown excellent feel for repeating his delivery and finding the strike zone consistently. He’ll have to show he can handle a full workload of starting after setting his early career high with 75 2/3 IP a year ago, but his combination of youth, strike-throwing and a bat-missing heater has the Braves excited for what comes next.

You have no idea when or if they will get a shot, and they will get almost no leash when they do get a shot. It’s just too big of a pain in the ass for fantasy, and while I like Wrobleski, his upside isn’t quite high enough to wait around and hope he ends up in the rotation. He has a plus mid 90’s fastball that misses bats and induces weak contact, both in the upper minors and in the majors. He pairs that with a potentially above average slider as his best out pitch, and he has a diverse pitch mix (he also throws a cutter, curve, sinker, and changeup). It all resulted in a 3.76 ERA with a 25.9/7.7 K%/BB% in 95.2 IP at Double-A and Triple-A. He got knocked around in the majors with a 5.70 ERA and 16.9/10.4 K%/BB% in 36.1 IP, but he has still able to show the skills could potentially translate if given the leash. He has no leash though, and he has no rotation spot. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.29/1.33/55 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/155 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.20261437908496727,0.16993464052287582,0.5882352941176471,0.27450980392156865,29.12,,,,64.38631790744466,1,0.25,49.89939637826961,36.392788732394365,1.0,MLB,-2.2861112000000006,77.4333344,40.0,38.548836779718314,30.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,36.333643430873245,31204,playerId

Still recovering from Tommy John surgery at the time of the trade, he finally got to a good place with his health in 2023 by making 16 starts on a limited workload. Pitching with fewer restrictions last season, he put himself back on the prospect radar with a strong campaign that saw him begin at Double-A Midland before earning a late-season promotion to Triple-A Las Vegas. Between the two levels, he combined for a 3.44 ERA in 24 games (23 starts) with 119 strikeouts and 37 walks over 130 2/3 innings. The Athletics called him up in May 2025, and he made six starts in the Majors before undergoing hip surgery in June that will likely keep him out the rest of the 2025 season. Though Hoglund may never get back the electric stuff he possessed earlier in his career, the A's were encouraged to see his fastball velocity tick back up to the low-90s. He has also experimented with adding a two-seamer and cutter. His low-80s slider now features more sweeping action and works as his main secondary pitch. He has also improved his low-80s changeup, creating a solid three-pitch mix that is enhanced by a strong ability to consistently throw strikes. Now three years removed from Tommy John, the A's are hopeful that Hoglund can develop into a solid back-end rotation piece, especially if he can successfully develop a fourth pitch. The Florida native was regularly going deep into starts in his big league cameo (6.40 ERA with 23 strikeouts to 11 walks across 32 1/3 innings) before going down with the injury and is expected to make a full recovery before the 2026 season.

The 5-foot-11 right-hander has developed two plus pitches in his 91-94 mph fastball and 80-82 mph changeup. Henderson’s heater averaged over 17 inches of induced vertical break at Triple-A, placing it above many bats at the top of the zone, and that movement profile helped it play above the velo. The changeup is his best pitch with sufficient fade and separation to generate plenty of whiffs on its own. Henderson’s heat map is, as expected, more vertically focused as a result. He eschewed a low-80s slider for more of an 87-89 mph cutter during his time with Nashville for a sharper, gloveside look, but even so, seven-eighths of his pitch usage comes from the fastball or change. Henderson repeats his delivery well, rarely pitching out of a full windup, and he’s become a regular strike pumper at the upper levels. That said, he can get hit around if the fastball seeps below the top of the zone or if he doesn’t bury the changeup. Added to the 40-man roster last November, the 23-year-old has dominated in his early tastes of the Major Leagues, firmly answering questions about whether his two best pitches could work as a starter in The Show.

He was lights out at Double-A with a 3.30 ERA and 32.6/3.9 K%/BB% in 46.1 IP. The fastball only sits 92.5 MPH but it gets good movement and is a bat missing weapon. The nasty changeup is his best secondary and a heavily used pitch that both misses bats and induces weak contact. He rounds out the arsenal with a mediocre cutter. Plus control with an excellent secondary and a bat missing, low 90’s fastball can definitely work, but lack of a good breaking ball is a problem. Maybe he’s just a back end starter, but I think there is some mid rotation upside in here, and if he can develop a legitimate breaking ball (he’s still only 22 as of this writing), I don’t think it’s out of the question for him to end up a legit impact fantasy starter. You also have to trust Milwaukee with a guy like this. Henderson is definitely a nice proximity arm to target even in shallower leagues. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.31/1.30/63 in 70 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.85/1.23/155 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6405228758169934,0.5882352941176471,0.6928104575163399,0.6601307189542484,64.09,76.92307692307692,15.384615384615385,,65.59356136820927,3,0.75,50.09655216366069,59.19229325728124,1.0,MLB,-3.919444500000001,97.03333400000001,70.0,67.56218807718437,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,60.80965143473298,31475,playerId

With the right players, they are proving the strategy can definitely work. Dana spent the entire season at Double-A as a 20 year old and excelled with a 2.52 ERA and 27.4/7.3 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP. He then got a taste of the majors and struggled with a 9.58 ERA and 15.4/13.5 K%/BB% in 10.1 IP, but that is basically meaningless. He racked up an impressive amount of innings for a 20 year old, and that was at the end of a very long season. He most certainly looks the part at a rock solid 6’4”, 210 pounds. The fastball sat 93.7 MPH and it gets good movement with bat missing ability. There could also be another tick or 2 coming down the line. The slider is nasty and even in his rough MLB debut it performed well with a 37.5% whiff%. The lesser used changeup, curve and cutter all performed really well too with a 37.5%, 50%, and 66.7% whiff%, respectively. He has about average command of the entire arsenal. He showed off mid rotation upside in 2024, and that was as a 20 year old in the upper minors and the majors. If he can take a step forward this off-season with his arsenal and command, there could be yet another level in here. – 2025 Projection: 4/4.27/1.34/87 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.73/1.20/194 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.0326797385620915,0.22875816993464052,0.18300653594771243,0.16339869281045752,14.23,,83.33333333333334,90.69767441860466,78.26961770623743,3,0.75,76.25989918841212,35.940464715944245,1.0,MLB,-5.711111200000001,100.0,70.0,33.608639414783276,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,46.12388773665248,31508,playerId

It was true during his three years at Georgia Tech where he struck out 14.7 per nine and walked a batter per inning. And it’s been true since the Reds took him in the sixth round of the 2022 Draft. He’s missed bats at every stop, with a 14.0 K/9 rate while reaching Triple-A in 2024, and while the walk rate is a little better than his Yellow Jackets days, he still carries a career 6.2 BB/9 rate into the 2025 season. Maxwell is a mountain of a man at 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, and he does not mess around on the mound. He comes at hitters with two power pitches. He throws his fastball almost 70 percent of the time and why not? It averaged over 99 mph last year and touched 103 mph, according to Synergy. When it’s right, it has good carry up in the zone and misses a lot of bats. So does his power 88-90 mph slider with cutter-like action, but he only lands it in the zone about half the time. There was some progress during Maxwell’s first year of pro ball as he shaved quite a bit off his walk rate, but it crept back up in 2024 even as the Reds were pleased with how he handled high-leverage situations they put him in. He’s knocking on the door to help the big league bullpen out, and what kind of role he might have will be completely dependent on any ability to find the strike zone more consistently.

He’s done nothing but start since then, making it up to Triple-A, the first place he had any kind of prolonged struggles, as he lost his feel a bit over his nine starts with Albuquerque. There’s confidence that Palmquist will make the necessary adjustments to find success both there and in the big leagues because he’s shown the ability to do so at every level since he’s entered pro ball. With a funky delivery that adds plenty of deception, and a lower arm slot, all of the left-hander’s pitches play up despite them grading out as largely average across the board. His fastball averages only around 91 mph, but it misses more bats than it should thanks to carry up in the zone from that lower slot. He’ll actually throw two different kinds of sliders -- a big sweepy one in the upper 70s and a slightly harder, cutter-ish one, both of which can miss bats. His low-80s changeup is also effective and hard to square up. Other than his time in Triple-A, Palmquist has largely been around the zone as he’s moved up the ladder and he loves going right after hitters and pitching inside without fear. He’s added a little strength and answered some durability questions with his 2024 campaign, so there’s hope he can start long-term, even if he is first called upon to help out of the bullpen should the need arise in Denver.

He put up a 14.4% BB% in 97.1 IP at mostly Double-A. They moved him into the bullpen when he got the call to Triple-A, and the control didn’t improve in short outings either with a 14.3% BB%. He finished the season with a 3.33 ERA and 30.5/14.4 K%/BB%. His evaluation basically remains exactly the same from last off-season. He’s 6’7”, 190 pounds with premium stuff and super high upside. The upper 90’s fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon and his breaking balls are plus and miss bats. You hate to say it, but it is really a reliever profile right now. It’s far too early into his development process to write him off as a starter though, and I highly doubt Milwaukee is ready to do that either. Even if he breaks into the majors in the bullpen, he will definitely be a candidate to get transitioned back into the rotation at some point too. I’ll keep betting on the huge stuff and let the chips fall where they may. – 2025 Projection: 3/3.91/1.34/67 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.58/1.27/183 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.673202614379085,0.8104575163398693,0.21568627450980393,0.6209150326797386,60.1,,,,86.11670020120724,1,0.25,66.7404426559356,62.42415492957746,1.0,MLB,-4.005555600000001,98.06666720000001,40.0,66.49224655887325,30.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,53.03484439149297,31623,playerId

After he showcased his usual stuff in the Cape Cod League that summer, the Giants took him in the second round and paid him a well-over-slot $1,866,200. He dominated in his first full pro season and advanced to Double-A before getting shut down with an elbow sprain in late July, then posted a 5.42 ERA in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League during a mostly healthy 2024. Whisenhunt may feature the best changeup in baseball, posting outlandish chase (49 percent) and swing-and-miss (47 percent) rates while recording 71 of his 135 strikeouts (second in the PCL) with his cambio in Triple-A. He sells his tumbling 78-81 mph change with fastball arm speed and can manipulate its depth and shape. He sets it up with a 92-94 mph two-seamer that reaches 96 with some sink, but it didn't have enough life to avoid getting hammered last year when he didn't command it well. Whisenhunt never has demonstrated great feel for spin, and while his low-80s slider is a bit better than his upper-70s curveball, neither is particularly effective. He struggled with a tighter zone and smaller ballparks in the PCL, and his strike-throwing regressed before rebounding in the final two months. He has the athleticism to repeat his delivery well enough to have at least average control. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and his changeup alone should help him carve out a role in San Francisco.

The two main things he has going for him though are that all of his pitches can miss bats (sinker, change, cutter, slider), and he’ll have a great ballpark at his back if he does get a shot in the rotation. Strikeouts and a run suppressing home ballpark could be good enough to make an impact. The changeup is a legit double plus weapon and 93.2 MPH sinker can be asset when it’s at it’s best, but it wasn’t at it’s best in 2024. The slider and cutter also show promise as legit 3rd and 4th pitches, so there is a world where everything comes together and Whisenhunt can thrive in the rotation. But I think the most likely world is that he ends up in the bullpen, or as a back end 4-5 IP type guy. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.44/1.38/55 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.33/135 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.30065359477124187,0.12418300653594772,0.7647058823529411,0.33986928104575165,36.13,73.91304347826086,,75.55555555555556,45.67404426559356,3,0.75,56.48359529155609,43.253758352044635,1.0,MLB,-2.552777800000001,80.63333360000001,70.0,44.9426275456134,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,47.35084911552603,31676,playerId

He climbed steadily through New York's system until getting rocked in Triple-A in 2024, though he recovered to pitch better there this year and made his big league debut in May. The Giants acquired him as part of a package for Tyler Rogers two months later. Tidwell displayed good four-seam velocity in the 94-96 mph range, topping out at 98, with decent riding action, but lefties in particular feasted on the pitch, slugging .606 against it at Triple-A. The 6-foot-4 right-hander also worked in a 92-94 mph sinker with almost double the armside movement to give another fastball look. He works with a variety of gloveside offerings between an 80-83 mph sweeper, an 82-85 mph traditional slider and a sharper 87-89 mph cutter. The sweeper, averaging around 15 inches of break, was a menace against righties. Tidwell also mixed in an occasional 81-84 mph changeup and upper-70s curveball. The former Volunteer struggled to adapt to the Major League ball and more advanced hitters at the Minors’ top level, and his 13.7 percent walk rate was seventh-highest in Triple-A (min. 80 IP). Some evaluators believe Tidwell may have been getting too fine in his location and that he needs to trust his stuff will play in zone more often. If he still can’t tame the control woes, his stuff would certainly play in a shorter relief setting.

He put up a 5.93 ERA with a 19.8/13.7 K%/BB% in 85 IP. Triple-A was messing around with the automated strikezone and challenge system, so a lot of guys struggled there, but they are also the only level to use the MLB ball, which adds a different dynamic to evaluating pitchers. Quinn Mathews and Brandon Sproat had a similar split between Double-A and Triple-A, but because theirs happened in a small sample at the end of the season, everyone is just ignoring it. Because Tidwell struggled over a longer sample, everyone has completely jumped ship. The stuff was still good at Triple-A with a 94.8 MPH seamer and a plethora of secondaries that missed some bats and induced weak contact. I’m also docking Tidwell much more than Mathews/Sproat, but a part of me is seeing some picking and choosing with these evaluations. I would be careful about giving up on Tidwell so far, or conversely, maybe be careful about crowning Sproat and Mathews.

Drafted by the Royals in the third round of the 2022 MLB Draft, he thrived immediately after turning pro, earning Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors for Kansas City in 2023. Headlining a prospect package sent to the Athletics in the Lucas Erceg deal at the 2024 Trade Deadline, the right-hander joined Double-A Midland and anchored the RockHounds' rotation -- posting a 2.61 ERA in seven starts with 52 strikeouts in 41 1/3 innings -- all the way to an appearance in the Texas League championship. In all, Barnett combined for a 4.20 ERA in 26 games (25 starts) between Double-A Northwest Arkansas and Midland and finished with 161 strikeouts and 49 walks across 133 innings. Barnett leads a four-pitch mix with his fastball. Though it may not reach the 99 mph it once did earlier in his career, he can still rev it up to about 96 mph while sitting around 94. His mid-80s slider has evolved into more of a sweeper with good bite and emerged as a strong secondary pitch, providing solid separation in velocity from his upper-70s curve. He also utilizes a mid-80s changeup that is especially effective against left-handed batters. Listed at 6-foot and 218 pounds, Barnett is showing all the traits of a “bulldog” on the mound who goes right after opposing hitters. He demonstrated strong improvement in his overall strike-throwing ability with his cleaned-up three-quarters arm slot that at times got a little long in the past. If the improvements hold up at the next level, the A’s view him as a long-term starter and believe he could push his way up to the big leagues at some point in 2025.

The coming ballpark downgrade definitely makes me a little more hesitant to go after him than if they were sticking in Oakland, but Barnett definitely qualifies for that pitching prospect aisle that I love to shop in, and he gets a clear opportunity boost. – 2025 Projection: 4/4.29/1.34/91 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.92/1.28/150 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.130718954248366,0.24183006535947713,0.27450980392156865,0.20261437908496732,20.55,65.21739130434783,,,60.7645875251509,2,0.5,53.22693406817717,31.98692692386201,1.0,MLB,-2.6000000000000014,81.20000000000002,55.0,33.0785780771586,25.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,38.375360134721376,31741,playerId

The transition has gone well, as he performed well in Double-A and the Arizona Fall League to cap his first full pro season and won All-Star accolades and a championship in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in his second. He led the PCL with 12 victories and strikeout rate (24 percent) while ranking second in ERA (3.83) and fourth in strikeouts (128 in 124 2/3 innings). Blubaugh operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that tops out at 97 and comes out of a high arm slot with armside run and carry that keeps it off barrels. His most effective secondary pitch is a low-80s changeup with fade and depth. Houston has helped him develop a sweeping low-80s slider that elicits chases but gets pounded when he leaves it over the plate, and he also has an upper-70 curveball with similar issues and a mid-80s cutter. A basketball and football standout as an Ohio prepster, Blubaugh has the athleticism to repeat his upright delivery with a long arm action in back. With a little more refinement of his arsenal, control and command, he could be a No. 4 starter in the big leagues. If that doesn't happen, he'll likely be a spot starter and multi-inning reliever.

Well, it’s not exactly inexplicable, it’s explicable because he always had the nasty stuff to get here if he stayed healthy. Can we say pitching 48.1 IP is “staying” healthy? I don’t know. But what I do know is that the high octane stuff is elite enough to take on that risk. The 4-seamer sits mid to upper 90’s, and while it’s not a huge bat missing weapon without tons of vertical break, he also throws a mid to upper 90’s sinker which pounds the ball into the dirt. He can start throwing the sinker more, and he can also work on the movement profile of the 4-seamer now that he’s healthy. The real money maker is the truly elite slider. It put up a 50% whiff% in 11.2 IP in the majors and a 71.4% whiff% in 10 IP at Triple-A. He rounds out the arsenal with a lesser used changeup, and how good he can get that pitch could be a big factor in just how high the upside will end up. Digging into the nitty gritty of his pitch mix is almost besides the point though, because staying healthy is essentially the only thing he needs to do. The Mets drafted him 10th overall and didn’t sign him because they didn’t like his medicals. He then underwent shoulder surgery shortly after that, but looked so good in Independent ball when he returned from the surgery, that the Rangers selected him 3rd overall the next year. Which he followed up with Tommy John in 2023, returning for the 2nd half of 2024, where he put up a 1.96 ERA with a 39.6/3.6 K%/BB% in 36.2 IP at mostly AA and AAA. It’s about as risky of a health profile as it gets, but all pitchers are so risky, that I don’t want to discount him too much because of it. I’ll take on extra risk when the upside is a true ace. The downside could be a high leverage reliever though if he keeps getting hurt. 2025 Projection: 9/3.71/1.20/146 in 130 IP Prime Projection: 12/3.35/1.13/190 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4901960784313726,0.5359477124183006,0.6601307189542484,0.5947712418300654,55.81,,,,95.77464788732395,1,0.25,74.22535211267606,62.25537323943662,0.8,MLB,-1.6416666999999983,69.70000039999998,35.0,59.827112031830985,35.0,0.5719999999999998,Mixed,42.612200494323936,31843,playerId

He put up a 7.50 ERA with a 27.2/13.6 K%/BB% in 18 IP. The fastball was down to 94.1 MPH. The good news is that the secondaries (changeup, curve, slider) still missed a ton of bats and induced weak contact, and he also pitched much better at Double-A with a 1.10 ERA and 29.0/3.2 K%/BB% in 16.1 IP. We can give him a pass for his performance at Triple-A due to the injury, but Tommy John surgery knocked out his entire 2021 season, so injuries are starting to become a concern. He’s never pitched more than 88.1 IP in a season, so it’s a question if he can truly put up a full starter’s workload year after year, and also what level of stuff he can hold over those innings. His value took a hit this year, but it would be too risk averse to completely tank his value. I’m holding relatively strong. 2025 Projection: 4/4.13/1.32/74 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.68/1.19/163 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4183006535947712,0.6928104575163399,0.24183006535947715,0.49673202614379086,46.84,,,,87.5251509054326,1,0.25,67.83199195171025,54.18719718309859,0.8,MLB,-3.3861111999999984,90.63333439999998,35.0,55.613159314929575,35.0,0.5719999999999998,Mixed,44.90258857171831,31872,playerId

He put up a 7.49 ERA with a 13.9/13.3 K%/BB% in 33.2 IP. And quite frankly, there are no silver linings. None of his pitches were good. The fastball in particular got destroyed. The slider was the only pitch to perform halfway decently. And worst of all, his elite control from the minors was nowhere to be found, probably because he didn’t want to throw the ball over the plate with how easily his stuff was getting crushed. He didn’t only get hit up in the majors, he also didn’t pitch well at Triple-A with a 6.20 ERA in 61 IP, although at least it came with a 60/13 K/BB. Plus control of a 94.6 MPH fastball with a diverse pitch mix and an above average slider is a good profile in theory, but in practice, it’s clearly not working. The fastball is way too hittable despite the good velocity.

He fits the mold of finesse pitchers whom the Guardians have excelled at helping upgrade their stuff, and they signed him for $1.3 million as a 2022 second-rounder. While he hasn't added any velocity as a pro, he ranked fifth in the Minors last year with 165 strikeouts in 133 2/3 innings and was named a Double-A Eastern League All-Star after posting a 2.06 ERA in 15 outings there. Messick's great equalizer is his tumbling low-80s changeup, which elicits plenty of chase and swings and misses, along with well-above-average grades from some evaluators. It helps him miss bats with his low-90s fastball, which also benefits from a flat approach angle and good carry up in the zone. He has mostly scrapped his upper-70s curveball and turned what had been an upper-70s slider into a more cutterish mid-80s version that played as an average offering last year. Though the 6-foot, 225-pound Messick is more burly than athletic, he repeats his delivery well and provides consistent strikes. He hides the ball well and isn't afraid to challenge hitters with his less-than-overpowering arsenal. Similar to Joey Cantillo but with more strike-throwing ability, he offers a high floor as at least a back-of-the-rotation starter.

He put up a 2.06 ERA with a 32.3/8.0 K%/BB% in 65.2 IP at the level. I still think he’s a back end starter, but every higher level he’s able to miss bats at that pace is a slightly better chance that he could reach that #4 starter upside, which would make him fantasy relevant.

He became the earliest drafted pitcher from the program when the Pirates took him No. 36 overall in the 2022 Draft, and he’s climbed the ladder relatively quickly, reaching Triple-A in his second full season and leading the organization in K/BB ratio for the second straight season while also topping all Pirates pitching prospects in BB/9 and WHIP. Sometimes lost in the shadow of the premium stuff coming from right-handers like Paul Skenes, Jared Jones and Bubba Chandler, Harrington combines solid stuff with an easily plus feel for pitching. He has as many as five pitches in his arsenal, and he’s not afraid to pull any arrow from his quiver. While his fastball averages between 92-93 mph and tops out at 95, it plays up because of its run and carry. He backs the fastball up with an array of secondary offerings, with his 83-84 mph sweeper with excellent spin rates the best of his breaking balls. His 84-85 mph splitter with tumble also serves as an above-average pitch that misses bats. His upper-80s cutter provides a shorter power breaker that plays well off of his sweeper, and he uses a low-80s curve effectively as well. Helping all of his pitches play up is Harrington’s ability to fill the strike zone, as he was one of the best in the Minors in strike percentage in 2024, and he’s adept at keeping hitters off-balance with his pitch mix. He has as high a floor as a future big league starter as anyone in the system as a result.

He has a heavily used low to mid 90’s fastball that is probably about an average pitch at best when you factor in his command over it. He combines that with a plus changeup, an average-ish sweeper, an average-ish cutter, and a lesser used curve which is a good pitch when he goes to it. None of his pitches really missed enough bats at Triple-A to get really overly excited, but they generally induced weak contact, and a 22.5% whiff% on the fastball, 30.0% whiff% on the changeup, and 33.3% whiff% on the lesser used curve isn’t that bad. It all led to a 2.61 ERA with a 25.1/4.1 K%/BB% in 117.1 IP in the upper minors. I see more of a low WHIP, mediocre K #3/4 starter on the MLB level, which isn’t bad, but it’s also not exactly the upside I love aiming for. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.30/1.32/72 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.86/1.23/144 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.17647058823529416,0.1568627450980392,0.7450980392156863,0.3464052287581699,32.57,64.0,0.0,,67.00201207243461,3,0.75,42.93164871582436,36.19657705053852,1.0,MLB,-3.2805555999999996,89.3666672,70.0,42.17747319516156,20.0,0.5199999999999998,Mixed,47.8531963778227,31989,playerId

He was limited to only 10 appearances between the Florida Complex and Florida State Leagues in 2023 and then erupted onto the scene in his second full season. He rose from Single-A St. Lucie to Double-A Binghamton while posting a 3.03 ERA and 1.17 WHIP. His 160 strikeouts were the most by a Mets farmhand while his 34.2 percent K rate ranked fifth among all Minor League qualifiers. Standing at 6-foot-1, Tong can look like the second coming of Tim Lincecum with his deceptive over-the-top delivery and good extension. His fastball only shows average velocity in the 91-94 mph range, but it plays well above that with elite induced vertical break (averaging above 20 inches in front of Statcast cameras in the FSL). He plays off that high pitch with a 74-76 mph curveball that he can drop in (with above 65 inches of vertical drop) for early strikes or tunnel off the heater for a K. He leaned on his 82-84 mph cut slider early in 2024 as he was looking to hone the pitch, but a 84-86 mph changeup (thrown with a Vulcan grip) was better at generating whiffs as a rare armside offering for him. He's increased his usage with the cambio in 2025, following a slight shift in where he held the baseball, and has held that swing-and-miss rate. Tong’s walk rate crept up as he went level to level, and it moved up again a touch in 2025. There is some concern that more advanced batters can lay off his north-south approach and that his unorthodox delivery will be difficult to maintain as he ages. But for now, Tong has the momentum and interesting profile of a pitcher who could climb into an MLB rotation by 2026, especially if the strikeouts keep coming.

Talk about making a statement. The low to mid 90’s fastball will play just fine. Here he is blowing a fastball by Spencer Jones . Granted, I think I could strikeout Spencer Jones right now, but still. It wasn’t just Jones, it was everyone . Showing that level of dominance in the upper minors was a big hurdle to clear.” … He wasn’t as good in his 2nd start at the level (and final start of the season) with 3 ER and a 5/4 K/BB in 3.1 IP, but we already knew that below average control is a weakness in his game. Seeing the stuff so clearly fully translate was exciting. The breaking ball is absolutely filthy, the bat missing fastball can be a plus pitch despite the mediocre velocity, and he rounds out the arsenal with a cutter and changeup. If he can improve him control/command, Tong could be a beast, and even if he can’t, he can be a high K, mid rotation starter. I’m definitely in on him. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 11/3.71/1.27/174 in 155 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9738562091503268,0.9673202614379085,0.4183006535947712,0.954248366013072,84.53,92.0,89.47368421052632,,66.19718309859155,3,0.75,74.5848558845332,81.04919955958663,1.0,MLB,-5.1888888999999985,100.0,70.0,85.806259867876,20.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,69.6128169405442,32157,playerId

Like Chandler, Morales is a huge talent ($3 million signing bonus in 2023), with a scouts dream build at 6’3”, 190 pounds (although Chandler was more built up and wider), super obvious humongous stuff, below average control, and mediocre results at High-A. Morales put up a 4.22 ERA with a 24.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 81 IP at the level while Chandler put up a 4.75 ERA with a 25.6/10.9 K%/BB% in 106 IP at the level. Just because Chandler exploded to elite prospect status in 2024 doesn’t mean Morales will, but that high end outcome is definitely in the cards. Morales’ delivery is so easy and athletic it almost lulls you into a false sense of security before he fires off a mid to upper 90’s fastball, a potentially plus breaking ball, and a promising, but still developing changeup. He can definitely still look pretty raw on the mound, making the bullpen a very possible destination long term, but this is the type of upside you want to chase.

Bloss didn’t exactly hit the ground running with the Blue Jays organization, posting a 6.91 ERA over 27 1/3 innings at Triple-A Buffalo, but his cumulative ‘24 line in the Minors looks much cleaner, with a 3.18 ERA and 88 strikeouts over 93 1/3 innings pitched. Bloss thinks about the game at an extremely advanced level and has made use of the Blue Jays' many resources, diving into the data of his pitches to tinker away. While his fastball sits 93-94 mph, he reached up to the 97-98 mph range early in Spring Training, and he has a curveball that has grown since he made the move to pro ball. Bloss also throws a couple of variations of his slider, adjusting speeds and the depth of its break. Bloss started slowly out of the gate again to begin his first full season in the Toronto organization with a 6.46 ERA and 1.94 WHIP over six starts with Buffalo. He left a May 3 start early, and 10 days later, the Jays announced that he needed right elbow surgery to repair his ulnar collateral ligament. That pushes back a return to the Majors until 2026 at the earliest, but before Bloss can get to The Show, he’ll need to show his stuff and command can also come back to 2024 form after a lengthy period of recovery and rehab.

He throws a diverse 5 pitch mix, and his sweeper stands out the most as a bat missing weapon in both the majors (44.4% whiff%) and AAA (38.5% whiff%). None of his pitches are really standout though, and his control has been average to below average throughout his career. He wasn’t all that great in the minors either with a 23.3/9.5 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP.

He only had one full season with the Gators (2021), sandwiched between the pandemic in '20 and Tommy John surgery in '22. His size, stuff and left-handedness still intrigued the Pirates enough to take him in the second round that summer. He came back in July 2023, and pitched his way from High-A Greensboro to Double-A Altoona in '24, with a stress response in his left shin ending his season in late July. The Pirates were thrilled with how Barco, a physical 6-foot-4 left-hander, looked in 2024 further removed from elbow surgery, especially given that he spent most of it pitching in hitter-friendly Greensboro. His fastball now sits around 93 mph and touches 95-96, more like it did pre-TJ. It has good sink, getting ground-ball outs and missing a fair amount of bats, too. His low-80s slider is an out pitch, but perhaps his biggest development was the scrapping of his changeup for a splitter as his offspeed offering. It’s had inconsistent direction at times, but it’s an absolute spin-killer with RPMs under 1,000, giving him another bat-misser and worm-killer. Overall, Barco has done a nice job of finding the strike zone, though improved command of that splitter would make that an even more effective arrow in his quiver. The gloves could come off more this year, and it wouldn’t surprise anyone if he’s knocking on the door to Pittsburgh by the end of it.

No injury is good, but it’s not an arm injury, so I’m not concerned. He throws a low to mid 90’s fastball from a deceptive lefty delivery, to go along with a plus slider and a pretty good splitter. He generally attacks zone with average control. He might end up a back end guy, but there is high K mid rotation upside in here too. – 2025 Projection: 1/4.37/1.36/41 in 45 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.94/1.29/158 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4836601307189542,0.6209150326797386,0.30065359477124187,0.48366013071895425,48.11,88.0,46.666666666666664,,45.47283702213279,3,0.75,53.95705606186135,50.15646962165147,1.0,MLB,-2.7055556000000003,82.4666672,70.0,53.87744096649544,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,51.73818187492295,33174,playerId

He was dominant as a Hoosiers reliever in 2023 (63 strikeouts in 37 innings), leading the Brewers to select him in the eighth round as a senior sign with a $10,000 bonus. The 6-foot-3 right-hander dominated across three levels his first full season of pro ball, earning MLB Pipeline’s All-MiLB First Team honors as a reliever. His 0.94 ERA, 1.43 FIP and 42.4 percent strikeout rate were each tops among 1,300 Minor Leaguers with at least 50 innings pitched. The star of the show here is Yoho’s 77-80 mph changeup, a cartoonish pitch that acted as close to Devin Williams’ airbender as you’ll find in the Minor Leagues. Thrown from a low three-quarters slot, the pitch averaged 18 inches of armside movement at Triple-A with about 15 mph difference from Yoho’s low-90s sinker. The change looks very similar to the heater out of the hand until the last moment when it ducks below bats, leading to a 51 percent whiff rate across High-A, Double-A and Triple-A. Yoho also works with a 75-77 mph, high-spin, sweeping slider that moves just as much gloveside – creating a giant window of movement – and a tighter upper-80s cutter as a bridge option. Yoho’s walk rates crept up as he climbed the Milwaukee ladder, and free passes have been his biggest bugaboo in his initial Major League looks in 2025. The stuff remains too good to keep Yoho down for long, and if he can find the zone with more regularity in The Show, he has the upside of a high-leverage arm.

The Rockies literally don’t prepare their pitchers at all for eventually pitching with different air. That makes total sense to me based on how bad their franchise is. If I was heading up a franchise where the ballpark had different air, and their entire history of pitching in that environment was nothing short of horrific, the strategies necessary to thrive in that environment would run deep throughout my organization from rookie ball on up. Dollander answered the question as if nobody has even mentioned it to him ha. I just find that kinda wild. Now, maybe trying to change who you are as a pitcher would only get in your head, and maybe there literally is no good strategy for it, so I guess you might as well not think about it. I’m open to that being the case, but either way, for fantasy purposes, it just reinforces that I’m never going to be the high guy on Colorado pitching prospects, It sure seems like if anyone can slay the beast, it will be Dollander, and as a baseball fan, I’m rooting for him hardcore to be the one who breaks through. A true ace at Coors would be awesome. If we forget about Coors for a second, Dollander is an elite pitching prospect on his own merits with a 2.59 ERA and 33.9/9.4 K%/BB% in 118 IP at High-A and Double-A (he was equally dominant at both stops). The mid to upper 90’s fastball is a double plus bat missing weapon, which he combines with a 3 secondaries (gyro slider, curve, change) that aren’t as good as the fastball, but can be above average to plus pitches in their own right. Below average control is the only other demerit besides Coors Field. I’ve had a zero tolerance policy for Coors pitching prospects my entire life, and it has yet to come back to bite me. Maybe Dollander will be the one to finally make me regret it, and I’m genuinely rooting for him to be the one, even if it won’t happen on my dynasty team. 2025 Projection: 4/4.28/1.33/96 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 11/3.79/1.24/185 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3202614379084967,0.5228758169934641,0.17647058823529416,0.35294117647058826,35.0,,,,88.73239436619718,1,0.25,68.76760563380282,46.818661971830984,0.825,MLB,-3.5694444999999995,92.833334,35.625,47.22059869154929,34.375,0.5182499999999998,Mixed,41.78468621119718,33482,playerId

He put up a 3.47 ERA with a 23.7/11.0 K%/BB% in 93.1 IP at mostly Double-A and Triple-A. Those K/BB numbers are not very impressive against minor league competition, and he was atrocious in the majors with a 16.71 ERA and 8.3/22.8 K%/BB% in 7 IP. The devasting splitter lived up to the hype and is definitely an at least plus bat missing weapon, but that seems to really be all he has. The fastball sits in the mid 90’s, but it doesn’t miss many bats, the slider is average at best, and the control is well below average.

Much like in his time with the Bobcats, Garcia showed he could miss bats with his stuff, even if he didn’t always know where it was going. Taking a flyer on a lefty like this on Day 3 of the Draft is not uncommon, but what has been surprising is that not only did the Mariners take Garcia in the 11th round of the ‘23 Draft, they let him start throughout his first full season. Garcia ran with the opportunity, pitching his way to Double-A and leading the organization in ERA (2.25) and K/9 (10.4) in 2024. He moved to the bullpen for good in his age-25 season in ’25 and rose to the Majors just before he was traded to the D-backs in the Josh Naylor deal. A terrific late bloomer story, the 6-foot-4 Garcia seems to be getting better the more mound time he gets, and his stuff was ticking up in the shorter role. His heavy two-seam fastball sits 96-98 mph and touches 100 with a ton of sink. From a low three-quarter slot, he works east-west off that with a mid-80s sweeper that averaged 15.4 inches of glove side movement at Triple-A -- equal to the arm side run of the sinker -- and generated a ton of swing-and-miss. He also has a sharper upper-80s hard slider/cutter that serves as his option for righties. That’s much needed since his changeup stays in the back pocket. Garcia’s lack of a changeup and his overall command, along with his advanced age, led to the move to the bullpen as he entered his mid-20s. That sinker-sweeper combo, however, should be enough to keep him in the bigs, especially if he can be limited to lefty-heavy appearances in the desert.

After he tied a Cavaliers record with 12 victories and winning most outstanding player honors at the Charlottesville Regional in 2023, the Red Sox drafted him in the fifth round. He added fastball velocity in his first full pro season, which made his quality changeup even more effective and helped him rank second in the system with 138 strikeouts in 103 2/3 innings while climbing to Double-A. Added strength boosted Early's fastball from 89-91 mph at Virginia to 92-94 with a high of 96 in 2024, and it bores down and in against right-handers. His lively low-80s changeup has similar action, and he can land it for strikes or use it as a chase pitch. He also can keep batters off balance with a pair of breaking balls, a sweeping low-80s slider that has become a solid offering and an upper-70s curveball. Early can't overpower hitters but has the feel to provide consistent strikes without catching too much of the plate. He throws his fastball just one third of the time, just enough to keep hitters honest and set up his secondary pitches, and his heater may need more velocity or life at higher levels. He's probably not more than a back-of-the-rotation option, but he may have the highest floor among Red Sox starting pitching prospects.

The Orioles took him in the third round in 2022 but did not sign him after a concerning MRI, so McLean returned to post a .911 OPS and a 3.30 ERA in Stillwater. The Mets selected him in the third round in 2023 and allowed the former Cowboy to be a two-way player up until late June 2024 after he struck out 52.2 percent of the time through 17 games as a Double-A hitter. McLean finished with a 3.78 ERA and 116 strikeouts in 109 2/3 innings between High-A and Double-A. Now with his focus fully on the mound, McLean could be cleared for major takeoff in his second full season. He held his velocity well in Year 1, averaging 94-96 mph while topping out at 98, much as he did in college. There is some flat approach to his four-seamer out of his low release, and he gets ample armside movement on a sinker as well, leading to heavy groundball rates. The real monster is his 84-87 mph sweeper – a pitch with elite spin and horizontal movement averaging around 15-16 inches with Triple-A Syracuse. McLean can use the pitch well running away from righties or backfooting it to lefties. His 88-90 mph cutter bridges the gap between the two offerings, and he also mixes in an upper-80s changeup and a high-spin upper-70s curveball for a more complete arsenal. McLean’s walk rates were a touch high in 2024 but were consistent level-to-level. That had held in 2025, even as he's moved to the Major League ball in Triple-A, and then they actually improved as he gained confidence in the Majors. Mets officials point out that he’s an ultimate competitor on the bump who tries to blow by hitters as much as he can. Settling into more of a routine has only helped his case as a starter -- and a standout one at the top level.

He turned down the Orioles after signability worries dropped him to the 18th round in 2022, then turned pro with the Guardians as a supplemental second-rounder in 2023. He logged a 2.32 ERA between Double-A and Triple-A while breaking into pro ball last year, then compiled a 0.77 mark in 13 appearances with Cleveland, including the playoffs. Walters used his fastball 82 percent of the time in college and 65 percent of the time in his pro debut, but hitters still can't do anything with it. His heater averages 95-97 mph and touches 99, playing better than its velocity thanks to its carry, command and deception. His mid-80s slider improved last year as he used it more often, and it plays as a plus pitch in part because batters have to focus on his fastball. After answering questions about whether such a heater-heavy approach would work in pro ball, Walters could become a closer in the future. To do so, he'll have to improve his walk rate after it tripled from 4 percent in his final two seasons with the Hurricanes to 12 percent last year.

New York did -- this time in the second round -- and signed him for slot at $1,474,500 after striking out 134 in 106 1/3 innings at Florida in 2023. Sproat flew through the Mets system in his first season, climbing from High-A Brooklyn to Triple-A Syracuse while posting a 3.40 ERA and fanning 131 in 116 1/3 innings. He was back in Syracuse for ’25, made four MLB starts in September and then was traded to the Brewers in January as part of the Freddy Peralta/Tobias Myers return. The 6-foot-3 right-hander’s fastball stands out more for its velocity than its shape. Sproat will run the four-seamer up to triple-digits on occasion and continued to sit in the 95-98 mph range even late in the season at Triple-A. But there isn’t great ride on the pitch, and batters at the Minors’ top level took advantage, hitting .380 off the fastball alone. Sproat can also work in a sinker around the same velo band, and the extra look helps generate a lot of groundball contact. His upper-80s changeup gets the right amount of separation and fade to give the former Gator a weapon against lefties, and after early struggles in 2025, he's leaned on the pitch more to right himself. Sproat works with both an 84-86 mph sweeper and harder 88-90 mph slider. The former is better at generating whiffs. A 79-81 mph curveball offers another occasional breaker. Sproat was control over command in his first taste of the Minors. He kept walk rates generally in check, but Triple-A batters proved they could bang pitches he leaves too much over the plate. That said, Sproat has the velocity and pitch mix to feature as a starter, and his ground-ball tendencies should be a good fit as a potential No. 3/4 starter for a Milwaukee club that prioritizes infield defense.

They love to use minor leaguers as guinea pigs, which I get, but life would be a lot easier if things were at least a bit more standardized among all levels. There was literally different rules for calling balls and strikes at Triple-A in the first 3 games of a series (fully automated) vs. the last 3 (umps call it with a automated challenge system). Then they switched the rules mid-season to just the automated challenge system with the umps calling them the rest of the time. Every level also uses different balls. Triple-A uses the MLB ball, while lower levels don’t. Enter Brandon Sproat, who utterly dominated at Double-A with a 2.45 ERA and 33.2/6.5 K%/BB% in 62.1 IP, only to completely fall apart at Triple-A with a 7.53 ERA and 16.3/8.5 K%/BB% in 28.2 IP. Was it the ball? Was it the strikezone? Was it the better competition? Was it that he was reaching a career high in IP? Was it a combo of everything? I don’t know exactly, but what I do know is that the stuff was still nasty. The 4-seamer sits 96.6 MPH and he has 2 potentially plus secondaries in his slider and changeup which both miss bats and induce weak contact. He also throws a cutter, curve and sinker, giving him a very diverse pitch mix. His control was below average throughout his college career, and it also was poor at the start of the season at High-A, so there is still some control/command risk in here even though he took a big step forward in that department overall. Does it worry me a bit that his numbers tanked so hard when he used the MLB baseball for the first time? It does. But at the end of the day the stuff don’t lie, and Sproat has monster stuff. – 2025 Projection: 3/4.08/1.32/87 in 90 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.63/1.20/189 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.3790849673202614,0.1830065359477124,0.46405228758169936,0.2222222222222222,31.73,80.0,57.89473684210527,,88.53118712273643,3,0.75,71.23544673614441,45.55690635765055,1.0,MLB,-2.4611112000000013,79.53333440000002,70.0,43.04857206729517,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,46.27852431028283,33850,playerId

He was the conference’s top arm again in 2023 and one of the best in the country, leading to him being the second pitcher taken in that summer’s Draft behind No. 1 pick Paul Skenes. The No. 7 overall selection started his pro career in 2024 with High-A Dayton and ended it with some early success in the big leagues. The right-hander has long had a reputation for his advanced feel for pitching, so much so that his stuff often gets short shrift. His fastball averaged around 93-94 mph at all levels in 2024, topping out at 96-97 and he throws both a four- and a two-seamer, the latter featuring solid sink to elicit a good amount of ground-ball outs. He has an outstanding changeup, thrown 86-87 mph with a ton of fade and to both sides of the plate when at its best, though he didn’t throw it as much nor was it quite as effective as during his junior year at Wake Forest. He’s leaned more on his mid-80s slider as a pro, throwing it as often as his four-seamer during his big league debut. One thing the Reds can be sure of is that Lowder is going to be in the strike zone consistently. He repeats his three-quarters arm slot and delivery extremely well and continues to be seen as the pitching prospect with the best pitchability in the game. He showed the ability to make adjustments and succeed as he climbed the ladder quickly, something he’s sure to do when he settles into the big league rotation.

He put up a 3.64 ERA with a 25.3/5.4 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at mostly Double-A, and then he got the call to the bigs and held his own with a 1.17 ERA (4.25 xERA) with a 17.2/10.9 K%/BB% in 30.2 IP. I trust the K/BB and xERA more than the ERA, but even with the underlying numbers being lackluster, there were other positive takeaways from the debut. Namely his 93.5 MPH fastball put up a very good 27.8% whiff%. Plus control of a good fastball is a very strong foundation, and Lowder is more than just that with a legit 4 pitch mix. The slider and changeup were less impressive in the majors, and he wasn’t putting up big strikeout numbers in the minors, so development of those secondaries will be huge to unlock more upside. As is, he projects as a solid mid rotation starter, but there is definitely upside for more. – 2025 Projection: 5/4.11/1.31/106 in 120 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.72/1.16/177 in 175 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7124183006535948,0.5163398692810458,0.8954248366013072,0.7254901960784313,70.08,85.71428571428572,57.14285714285714,,83.29979879275655,3,0.75,70.59296958219907,70.25953935376967,0.22749999999999998,MLB,-3.936111199999999,97.23333439999999,50.6875,74.2068619661309,39.3125,0.5490999999999999,Mixed,57.08037976475891,33876,playerId

He was the perfect candidate to absolutely blow up with a strong AFL showing, and while he hasn’t done that with a 9.45 ERA and 12/6 K/BB in 6.2 IP over 3 outings, he has established that his nasty stuff is legit. The fastball sits mid to upper 90’s, the slider is potentially plus, and the changeup is promising. He barely has any track record at all with a career high of 31 IP in 2022 in the SEC (52 IP if you include the 2022 Cape), so it’s a mystery if he can stay healthy or if he can maintain this level of stuff over an entire season, but pitchers take this path all the time, and the stuff is undeniable.

But it wasn’t until his second year of independent ball with Glacier in the Pioneer League that he got an affiliated bite when the Mets purchased his contract in June 2024. The right-hander zoomed through the system with appearances across three levels between High-A and Triple-A, finishing with a 2.68 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and 75 strikeouts in 74 innings. Pintaro also made four appearances in the Arizona Fall League as New York wanted him getting competition against top prospects while using the MLB ball. The 6-foot-2 hurler worked with Tread Athletics and five-year Major League catcher Austin Nola on a variety of pitching grips and mechanical fixes before catching on in the pros. His 89-92 mph cutter has been his bread-and-butter offering going back to college as a sharp pitch he can run in on lefties and away from righties. He has a pair of fastballs in his four-seamer and sinker around 93-95 mph, and he relied on the latter (a relatively newer pitch) more in his time at Triple-A. A mid-80s changeup gets a healthy amount of whiffs, and an 82-85 mph sweeper gives him a longer gloveside option. Pintaro stumbled a bit with control with Syracuse and Scottsdale, but he threw enough strikes earlier in 2024 to help his starting case. He has a deep enough arsenal to keep hitters off balance, and splits aren’t much of an issue either after he gave up zero homers to lefties during the regular season. The Mets gave him his Major League debut on June 25, 2025 and then moved him into the bullpen back in Syracuse, where his stuff has shown even better velocity in shorter spurts. That limits his overall role and value but should offer him a longer look in the Majors.

He’s better than Yamamoto, and you saw Yamamoto’s seamless transition, other than the shoulder injury. But that injury might have pushed LA to a six man rotation, which works just fine for Sasaki. His fastball sits in the upper 90’s and regularly hits over 100 MPH. The splitter is truly elite and the slider is plus. He has prototypical size at a projectable and athletic 6’2”, 187 pounds, and he has plus control/command of his stuff. He’s been so insanely dominant in Japan that he has basically already hit legend status with so many crazy feats, and he’s only 23 years old. He put up a 2.35 ERA with a 28.7/7.1 K%/BB% in 111 IP this year. He was even better in 2023 with a 1.78 ERA and 39.1%/4.9% K%/BB% in 91 IP. As you can see, the biggest and only red flag is injuries, as he has a career high of 129.1 IP. He battled an oblique injury in 2023 and right arm discomfort in 2024. The right arm discomfort is particularly concerning because his stuff was actually down a tick or two this year. It was still beastly, but would any of us be surprised if Tommy John/internal brace surgery was right around the corner? You can’t be too scared off by that, because even if he needs it, he should still return as an ace. He’s so easily the top pick in First Year Player Drafts, and while I don’t think he’s a no brainer for #1 overall prospect in the game, how can you not put a ready made ace in the top spot, injury risk be damned. He’s my top dog. – 2025 Projection: 12/3.06/1.04/175 in 150 IP Prime Projection : 16/2.72/0.92/240 in 185 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.11111111111111116,0.1503267973856209,0.1568627450980392,0.10457516339869281,13.11,,,,100.0,1,0.25,77.49999999999999,35.64649999999999,0.6799999999999999,MLB,-3.5888889000000006,93.06666680000001,32.0,31.86445002,38.0,0.5167999999999998,Mixed,33.652335869,35323,playerId

Following in the footsteps of his older brother, Patriots career wins record-holder M.D. Johnson (now with the Marlins), Ryan set his own school records in strikeouts for a season and career. His junior year ended with a 2.21 ERA and an impressive 10.8 K/9 ratio. All of the numbers, however, came from a delivery that scared scouts. The Angels weren’t afraid enough to let him get by their compensation pick after the second round in the 2024 Draft, going over slot to sign him for $1.75 million. Johnson’s funky delivery and unusual pitch usage are not typical for a starter. Using an abbreviated windup with a side step instead of a leg kick, he uses a low arm slot and a lot of effort to deliver five pitches, and he somehow throws them all for strikes. He threw his slider almost half of the time in 2024, an 80-81 mph breaker with a ton of lateral movement that missed bats at a 51-percent rate last year, according to Synergy. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s and can feature some armside run, and he’s able to crank it up to triple digits at times. He has a newer upper-80s cutter that’s now better than his upper-70s curve and mid-80s changeup. While his delivery creates deception and he commands the ball extremely well (2.1 career BB/9 rate in college), his fastball and even his slider can vary in how electric they are. The effort in his delivery have many thinking he’s destined to a bullpen eventually, but he’s going to get the chance to start for the time being.

Different can add some unknown upside, and while most teams are probably risk averse and shy away from different, I go towards it when it comes at a steep discount. And weirdness is far from the only thing going for Johnson. He has the size, production and elite K/BB to back it up at 6’6”, 215 pounds with a 2.21 ERA and 35.9%/3.3% K%/BB% in 106 IP in Conference USA. The fastball sits 92-95 but can hit the upper 90’s and the sweeper is a devastating pitch that he goes to often and racks up whiffs. He also throws a curve and change. If the Rays drafted him, I would feel so confident about naming Johnson a major target, but it’s definitely a red flag that he lasted until 74th and got picked by the Angels. I always say you can’t be too much of a slave to organization, so I’m not going to let it scare me off too much. I really really really like Johnson as a FYPD sleeper pick. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.95/1.26/165 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8954248366013072,0.6601307189542484,0.9411764705882353,0.8627450980392157,83.48,96.55172413793103,58.33333333333333,95.34883720930233,47.887323943661976,4,1.0,69.78415332949314,78.6864536653226,1.0,MLB,-4.344444500000002,100.0,85.0,84.51993609959679,15.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,72.78397124481856,35325,playerId

It would have made me legitimately sad to see Burns going to the Rockies. I know Cincinnati is no cake walk for pitchers themselves, but they just have a small ballpark, they don’t have different air. And we’ve seen plenty of pitchers have excellent seasons in Cincy (Castillo, Gray, Greene, Lodolo), so I wouldn’t let this landing spot move you off Burns at all. He has legit ace upside at a strong 6’3”, 210 pounds with a double plus fastball that sits in the upper 90’s and a double plus slider that put up elite whiff rates. It led to a 2.70 ERA with a ridiculous 48.8%/7.7% K%/BB% in 100 IP in the ACC. He’s inevitably going to get compared to Skenes, and Skenes put up a 1.69 ERA with a 45.2%/4.3% K%/BB% in 122.2 IP in the SEC. Skenes was in the tougher conference (although Burns pitched well in the SEC in 2022-23 before transferring to the ACC) with a better ERA, better walk rate and more IP. Burns isn’t as good as Skenes, but not many pitchers are better than Skenes, so that isn’t much of a knock. Burns also throws a curve and changeup to give him a legit starters pitch mix, and how well he can develop those pitches could dictate whether he becomes a true ace or a high K, #2/3 type. If your dynasty team is stacked with hitting, I don’t think taking Burns #1 overall in a FYPD should be ruled out. The teams that took Skenes over Langford and Crews in 2024 aren’t complaining too much right now, and while I already noted that Burns isn’t Skenes, the college hitting class also aren’t Langford/Crews. – 2025 Projection: 4/3.73/1.20/87 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.23/1.08/237 in 190 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9803921568627451,0.9411764705882353,0.9084967320261438,0.9738562091503268,95.24,,,,95.57344064386318,1,0.25,74.06941649899396,87.83029577464788,1.0,MLB,-4.763888900000001,100.0,40.0,93.73108873239437,30.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,65.67898992957747,35333,playerId

As a junior last spring, he finished among the Division I top five in ERA (2.03, fourth), strikeouts (145, fifth), average-against (.154, second) and wins (11, t-fourth). But he suffered a collapsed lung during what was believed to be dry needling treatment before the AAC Conference Tournament. He returned in time to throw 7 1/3 innings of one-run ball against Wake Forest and fellow top 2024 Draft talent Chase Burns in the NCAA Greenville Regional. While some teams had medical concerns about Yesavage, the Blue Jays selected the hurler 20th overall in July and signed him for $4,177,500. Yesavage traveled to the Blue Jays’ facility in Dunedin, Fla., for baseline work with Toronto staff but didn’t appear in games after the Draft. On stuff alone, he was one of the best arms in the class. His 93-95 mph fastball has great carry from a high, near-over-the-top release point (almost 7 feet), and that steepness plays to his advantage. A mid-80s slider/cutter shows good depth to generate heavy whiffs and a low-80s splitter can be another plus pitch, especially coming off the heater. A low-80s spike curveball provides another option but wasn't used as much last year. Oddly, Yesavage doesn't have a pitch that moves regularly gloveside but makes everything work with the steep angle. Yesavage has a bulldog mentality on the bump and brings a physical presence at 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. He showed improved fastball command during his days in college that helped fuel his rise to prominence. He's climbed three levels from Single-A to Double-A in his first full season, racking up strikeouts at every stop.

But he’s not just the product of his competition with 3 potentially plus pitches in his mid 90’s fastball, hard slider, and nasty splitter. He has weapons to get guys out from both sides of the plate and his control is solid. He likely slid to 20th in the draft because of a collapsed lung that he suffered in May, which I guess does add some unknown long term risk, but all signs seem to indicate that he is okay now.

He excelled on the mound, winning Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Year accolades while striking out 105 in 69 innings and relying heavily on his fastball. After signing for an over-slot $2 million in the second round, he has ranked among the Minor League leaders in strikeout percentage and quickly earned a promotion to Triple-A in his 2025 pro debut. The 6-foot-6 Tolle gets down the mound very well, creating elite extension (an average of 7-foot-4 with the Horned Frogs) and a low release height that helps his fastball play well above its velocity. The Red Sox had him focus on improving his strength and athleticism after he signed, and the result is that his heater has gone from sitting at 91 mph and topping out at 96 at TCU to averaging 95 and peaking at 99 this year. His combination of velo and shape has proven unhittable so far, as his fastball generated an unfathomable 46 percent swing-and-miss rate in the first half of the season. Tolle was a polarizing prospect in the Draft, with some scouts wowed by his fastball metrics and others seeing him as more of multi-inning reliever with just one weapon. To enhance his chances of making it as a starter, Boston has had him dial back his fastball usage (75 percent last spring) and work on improving his average mid-80s sweeping slider and fringy upper-80s changeup, both of which have added power as well. He's pounding the strike zone and has a bulldog mentality, two more reasons the Red Sox think he can become a frontline starter.

The fastball might not be huge, the control might be not be great, but he’s a big lefty (6’6”, 250 pounds) with an effective low 90’s fastball and a diverse pitch mix. He’ll never likely get the big prospect hype, but before you know it he’ll be knocking on the door of the bigs while continuing to pitch effectively at every level. He put up a 3.21 ERA with a 37.1/11.0 K%/BB% in 81.1 IP his junior year. He was a two way player in college, so that gives you an idea of his general athleticism. He doesn’t have the highest upside, and there is also risk, but like Cantillo, he just feels like a guy who will keep getting the job done. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.91/1.30/158 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9607843137254902,0.9019607843137255,0.8758169934640523,0.9607843137254902,92.56,96.55172413793103,94.44444444444444,,23.74245472837022,3,0.75,61.00527494468728,81.51584623064055,1.0,MLB,-4.583333400000001,100.0,70.0,90.36275386919218,20.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,71.66323924113648,35466,playerId

It starts, of course, with getting star Elly De La Cruz for $65,000. They also got reliever Luis Mey for $50,000, and he touched the big leagues for the first time in 2025. Not far behind him is Franco, who received just $10,000 to join the Reds in October of 2018. It’s been a slow climb for the right-hander, spending two years in Single-A Daytona in 2021 and 2022 following the pandemic, then missing the 2023 season following Tommy John surgery. He’s taken a nice step forward in 2025, pitching very well during his first taste of Double-A and earning a bump up to Triple-A as a result. From a pure stuff perspective, the 6-foot-2 Franco has an arsenal that gives him a chance to start. His fastball averages around 95 mph and tops out at 98 mph with decent spin and induced vertical break. He gets above-average spin on his 82-87 mph slider, which misses a good amount of bats, and he does a nice job of killing spin on his effective 86-90 mph changeup, giving him a third at least average offering. Strong and physical, Franco provides strong presence on the mound. Whether he can land in the back end of a big league rotation will depend on his command and control, which regressed a bit in 2025. If starting doesn’t work out, his stuff could play well in a bullpen role.

Macko was acquired from the Mariners as a smaller piece in the Erik Swanson deal, but has developed into one of the system’s highest-upside arms since then. After coming on strong down the stretch in 2023, Macko posted a 4.63 ERA in ‘24 with 105 strikeouts over 93 1/3 innings, climbing from High-A to Triple-A. The lefty was poised for a big camp in ‘25, but a bad-luck knee injury in February led to Macko undergoing arthroscopic surgery to clean up a meniscus tear. That will cut into his 2025 season significantly, but given that Macko was headed for Triple-A, he’ll still have time to make an impact if it all comes together. His fastball had started reaching the mid-90s more often and his curveball already profiles as a legitimate out pitch in the big leagues, so the upside is undoubtedly there. Macko’s slider is still a bit ahead of his changeup at this point. The knee surgery complicated what should have been a big year for Macko. He'll need a strong finish to 2025 to reposition himself for a chance at a Major League spot coming out of next spring. As much as you can chalk this up to a lost year, the Jays' increasingly deep line of arms threatens Macko's standing heading into 2026.

Though he lacked Buehler's polish, the Rangers bought into his upside and signed him away from a Clemson commitment with a well-over-slot $585,000 bonus in the 12th round of the 2019 Draft. His development has taken longer than expected, but he has looked better since becoming a full-time reliever in mid-2023. Collyer always has stood out with his feel for spin and can exceed 3,000 rpm on his mid-80s slider with sweep, an offering that can be devastating at times but also gets hit hard when he leaves it over the plate. He throws it more than his fastball and occasionally will turn it into a low-90s cutter. His heater has gained velocity this season, dealing at 96-98 mph and reaching triple digits with late armside run, and is his most effective option. Right-handers have trouble picking up Collyer's pitches as he slings them out of a low arm slot, but his funky wide-angle delivery hampers his control as much as it provides deception. His walk rate has climbed as he has risen through the Minors, and he'll be more of a middle reliever than a late-inning option if he can refine his control and command. He became a Minor League free agent after the season and Texas made sure to re-sign him.

The White Sox grabbed him in the 2023 Rule 5 Draft but returned him to Boston after he had nerve decompression surgery on his shoulder the following February. He missed three months with forearm inflammation in 2025 but logged a 2.27 ERA with 67 strikeouts in 47 2/3 innings at Triple-A when healthy, which allowed him to claim a spot on the 40-man roster in November. That effectiveness in Triple-A came because Drohan's fastball and slider were better than they had been previously in pro ball. His heater gained a tick in velocity, sitting at 93-94 mph and touching 96, and played better up in the strike zone. His mid-80s slider showed improved action, enabling it to get more chases as well as in-zone swings-and-misses. Drohan's upper-70s curveball gives him a second solid pitch, though his fading mid-80s changeup regressed and his upper-80s cutter got hammered last season. He cut his walk rate to 8 percent at Triple-A, down from 12 percent earlier in his career, and he thrived by working ahead in the count more often. He still has a ceiling of a back-of-the-rotation starter but now appears to have a greater chance of reaching it.

That said, he’s only topped 100 innings once (at High-A Hickory in 2022) and didn’t throw more than 60 during the regular season in either 2023 or 2024 due to shoulder issues. He was traded from Texas to St. Louis while on the Double-A IL in the 2023 Deadline deal for Jordan Montgomery and Chris Stratton but missed more than three months of what should have been his first full season as a Cardinal last year. The 6-foot-1 right-hander sat 94-97 mph in the Texas League before his latest stay on the shelf but was more in the 92-95 range over three Single-A rehab appearances late in the year. The heater can act like a plus pitch when the velo’s there due to a flat angle and good extension. His 80-83 mph curveball remains the best pitch in his arsenal, a real snapper that generated a ton of whiffs. He’d also show a harder slider and a low-80s changeup with tons of separation off the heat despite being a fourth pitch in terms of usage. Righties crushed Roby in 2024, especially the four-seamer if he didn’t locate it high enough in or above the zone. He’s at his best when he’s playing a north-south game with the heat and the deuce, but there’s also no grade for health. Roby threw 78 1/3 innings between Double-A and Triple-A in 2025 -- his highest mark since 2022 -- but needed Tommy John surgery in late July, a procedure that will shut him down until the second half of 2026 at the earliest.

He put up a 6.57 ERA with a 22.2/8.5 K%/BB% in 38.1 IP at mostly Double-A. He missed a large chunk of the season due to a shoulder injury, but he looked just as bad before the injury as he did when he returned from it. He can definitely bounce back in 2025 if he’s healthy with a mid 90’s fastball, plus curve, and diverse pitch mix, but he’s just not a very highly sought after pitching prospect right now.

He had developed into one of the top southpaws in the Minors and was on course to make his big league debut in 2023, but he blew out his elbow again that May and required a second elbow reconstruction a month later. The Marlins added him to the 40-man roster last November after he missed the entire 2024 season, and he should be fully healthy for this season. Fulton always has exhibited tremendous feel for spin, long featuring a plus downer curveball in the low 80s and adding a slightly harder slider with similar shape after he turned pro. He has two effective fastballs, a 93-95 mph four-seamer that climbs to 97 but can straighten out at times and a two-seamer with less velocity and more sink. His fading changeup has improved and can be an average offering, though it also can get too firm in the upper-80s. Fulton uses his 6-foot-7 frame to create plenty of extension in his delivery, and he has the athleticism to repeat his mechanics. He was making steady progress with his control and command until his elbow began acting up again in 2023. He still has the makings of a mid-rotation starter but needs to demonstrate the durability to handle the role.

Since taking him in the fourth round that year, he's run into some injury issues, with a shoulder strain keeping him on the shelf for all of the 2021 season. The next two seasons, the right-hander was on a super-cautious workload plan throwing just 127 2/3 innings combined in 2022 and 2023. Things started to click a bit more in 2024, with Raya reaching Double-A and finishing with close to 100 IP, earning a spot on the 40-man roster as a result. Raya has always excited with his pure stuff, but concerns about durability have dampened enthusiasm. He'll throw as many as six pitches at hitters, with both a four- and two-seam fastball that topped out at 97 mph and averaged over 94 in 2024. His best pitch is his plus mid-80s slider, a sweeper that misses a lot of bats. He still has a solid low-80s curve, and while his changeup wasn't used as much and was inconsistent, it still has solid characteristics. Last year, he added a 90-91 mph cutter that can be effective, though he needs to work on keeping it from blending with his sweeper. In addition to keeping his pitches distinct, Raya also needs to improve his control after walking 4.1 per nine last year. An area of focus for him this year will be his fastball command, with the belief that higher in-zone rates for his heater will bring that walk rate down. Now on the roster, it will be interesting to see how Raya responds as the workload constraints are loosened. Last Prospect 17 C.J.

Because of the pandemic, minor injuries and getting handled with care, he worked just 127 1/3 innings in his first four years a pro. He dominated early last season, striking out 39 percent of the batters he faced while reaching Double-A in June at age 21, but he blew out his elbow in his second start there and had Tommy John surgery later that month. He returned to Minor League game action in September 2025, made six Arizona Fall League starts and was traded to the Nationals for lefty Jake Bennett in December. Perales makes up for a lack of physicality with lightning-quick arm speed that generates four-seam fastballs that averaged around 99 mph in the AFL and touched 101 with a flat approach angle and huge carry up in the strike zone. He made progress with his secondary pitches last season, particularly with an upper-80s splitter that features devastating tumble when it's on. He uses both a dropping mid-80s slider and a tighter low-90s cutter, with the latter pitch improving significantly in 2024. While Perales is athletic and gets down the mound well to create extension, he's also small for a starter and throws with some effort. He looked more like a pitcher than a thrower last year, cutting his walk rate to 8 percent (down from 13 percent in his first three pro seasons) and using his secondary offerings more often rather than just dominating with his fastball. His control wasn’t back in the Fall League, but it was still early in his TJ comeback cycle. There’s a high ceiling here as a starter with a heavy dose of relief risk, if the Nats can’t help him find the zone.

It’s such a bummer as he was going full breakout and keeping it up at Double-A. He put up a 2.94 ERA with a 38.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 33.2 IP at High-A and Double-A. The stuff is electric with a plus to double plus mid to upper 90’s fastball. He made improvements to his changeup/splitter, which flashed nasty in 2024, and he rounds out the arsenal with a cutter and slider. He was a breakout candidate coming into the season because of the electric stuff, and it sure looked like the control and secondaries took real steps forward to combine with that stuff. He was on the path to be one of the most hyped pitching prospects this off-season before the injury. He wasn’t quite established enough in the upper minors for me to love taking the TJ discount on, and he’s not a big guy, so injury risk is a real downside, but the upside is certainly here, and he was on the verge of truly establishing himself. I would take him if the price is right, but I wouldn’t stick my neck out. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 11/3.78/1.26/160 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.423728813559322,1.0,0.0,0.288135593220339,46.71,82.75862068965517,,0.0,59.154929577464785,3,0.75,51.05245264691597,48.22985842642059,0.052500000000000005,0–1 yr,-3.0361112000000006,86.4333344,46.3125,53.12445768792618,43.6875,0.5631499999999999,Mixed,43.902047839566784,sa3014677,playerId

Hence, who was added to the 40-man last offseason when he became Rule 5-eligible, is the next in line to follow them. The Arkansas native has faced durability questions throughout his career but has shown strong results, including most recently a 2.71 ERA and 109 strikeouts in 79 2/3 innings for Double-A Springfield despite working around lat/chest/shoulder issues. Hence doesn’t cut an imposing figure on the bump at 6-foot-1, but his stuff certainly puts enough fear into batters. He buzzes a 92-96 mph fastball up in the zone from a three-quarters slot and touched as high as 98 mph in the Texas League last season. His best pitch, however, is a 82-84 mph circle changeup that looks much like the heater out of the hand until it dives armside. Per Synergy Sport, the pitch had an insane 73 percent overall whiff rate and a 63 percent whiff in-zone in 2024. Hence went to his gyro slider (around the same velocity) even more often with Springfield, and he’s added back an upper-70s curveball that many scouts loved during his amateur days. Hence has kept his walk rates in check throughout his career and would have a nailed-on starter profile if not for the durability concerns. Unfortunately, those have reared their head again 2025, beginning with a rib cage injury early in the season. He’s still yet to crack 100 innings in a campaign. His upside remains tremendous, but it's becoming clearer that a path out of the bullpen might be his best chance at bringing his dominance to the Majors.

Everyone has seemed to hyper focus on Hence’s issues, where a guy like Painter can literally undergo Tommy John surgery and everyone is completely good with it, nothing to see here. Jobe, Schultz, and Rocker have all dealt with injuries and haven’t racked up innings. But for Tink, his problems are like the main focus of his evaluation, and the main focus should be on his nasty stuff.

He combines the 3 nasty secondaries with a mid 90’s fastball that he can blow by hitters up in the zone with a good movement profile. It all led to a 2.71 ERA with a 34.1/8.1 K%/BB% in 79.2 IP. There is definitely injury as he’s battled a variety of injuries in his professional career (shoulder, chest and lat issues with year), and he’s not a particularly huge/broad guy, but they talk about him like he’s 5 foot nothing, 150 pounds. The guy is 6’1”, 195 pounds. He’s not that small. All pitchers have injury risk to me, so I’m not one to hyper focus on the injury risk. You know what you are getting into when you draft a pitching prospect, no matter how big and broad they are, they can all go down. I’m focused on Hence’s true top of the rotation upside, and I feel like there is a bit of a buying opportunity right now. 2025 Projection: 4/3.89/1.30/78 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/186 in 168 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.14569536423841056,0.3576158940397351,0.17218543046357615,0.1986754966887417,21.93,50.0,,,92.5553319919517,2,0.5,63.60035211267605,36.51462323943662,0.605,1–2 yr,-0.34722229999999854,54.16666759999998,45.125,31.140887111830985,34.875,0.5641999999999999,Mixed,28.64048272032394,sa3014709,playerId

The pandemic delayed his full-season debut until 2021, and a year later, he was already up in Double-A for a full campaign, posting a 4.85 ERA with 128 strikeouts in 128 innings for Rocket City. He returned to the Southern League to begin 2023, hit the injured list, was traded to the Mets in June, underwent Tommy John surgery and was moved once again to the Brewers that December. After seeing time in the Arizona Fall League last autumn, Crow is back to dominating the upper Minors in the Milwaukee system this summer. The 6-foot right-hander is one of the Minor Leagues’ kings of spin. His best offering is his 74-77 mph curveball -- a sharp breaker that averaged close to 3,000 rpm in Crow’s first two Triple-A starts. The pitch comes with 5 feet of drop, and if that wasn’t enough, its ample sweep makes it even tougher to track. He’s thrown it even more than his four-seamer in the early going with Nashville, a sensible move considering he’s only 91-94 mph with the heater. It has plenty of spin itself (around 2,600 rpm), but without the velo, Crow can’t blow it (or a sinker variation) past many bats. An upper-80s slider/cutter gives another look that he can spot gloveside. Crow doesn’t much throw his changeup, and as good as it is, his curveball only goes so far to neutralize lefties. Despite some early blips with the MLB ball at Triple-A, he has a long history of landing pitches in the zone and keeping walks at bay. Assuming health, he’ll have his best shot yet at a 40-man roster spot this offseason.

The latter didn't pitch much as an amateur but quickly opened eyes by pushing his fastball to 102 mph at the instructional league in the fall of 2021. He had his best season yet in 2024, logging a 1.98 ERA and 31 percent strikeout rate at Double-A and becoming the first hurler to spin two perfect innings in the Futures Game, making it a no-brainer for Texas to protect him on its 40-man roster in November. Teodo has the filthiest stuff in the system and one of the hardest two-seamers in the game, a sinker that somehow sits at 97-99 mph, climbs to 102 and is fairly impossible to lift. His tight upper-80s slider is even more devastating, breaking straight down and generating a 58 percent swing-and-miss rate in 2024. His changeup is his worst offering and still grades as plus, operating in the upper 80s with fade and depth. Likened to the late Yordano Ventura because of his small frame, electric arsenal and lightning-fast arm speed, Teodo still has yet to harness his stuff. He's athletic but his delivery has some effort to it, so he never has provided regular strikes and his walk rate rose to a career-worst 14 percent even while he dominated last year. He has the pitches to front a rotation, but his control may land him in the bullpen, where he would have obvious closer potential.

And on the off chance he can remain a starter, the strikeout upside is there to make an impact for fantasy. He put up a 1.98 ERA with a 30.7/14.0 K%/BB% in 86.1 IP at Double-A. The fastball sits upper 90’s and the slider is double plus. He also has a lesser used changeup that does have some potential. An upper 90’s fastball with a wipeout secondary and below average control is a classic back of the bullpen profile to get excited about. If Texas makes the decision to bullpen him, he could end up in the majors before you know it. 2025 Projection: 2/3.88/1.29/32 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 4/3.42/1.19/80/32 saves in 65 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.07627118644067798,0.5847457627118644,0.05084745762711862,0.17796610169491525,22.88,60.0,,83.33333333333334,58.55130784708249,3,0.75,59.19131455399061,35.588960093896716,0.8525,0–1 yr,-0.8694445000000002,60.433334,66.3125,32.32568812816901,23.6875,0.5555749999999998,Mixed,36.34260145767606,sa3015158,playerId

He struggled with his mechanics in 2023 and struck out only 78 batters in 94 2/3 innings for High-A Fort Wayne but bounced right back a year later. The right-hander spent the entire ’24 campaign with Double-A San Antonio and finished with a 4.03 ERA and 102 K’s in 96 frames in his age-20 season. He was one of only four 20-year-olds to throw more than 90 innings at the Minors’ second-highest level, joining Caden Dana, Robby Snelling and Yu-Min Lin on the list. Standing 6-foot-3, Lizarraga has good size on the mound but doesn’t possess stellar velocity yet, averaging just 90.1 mph on his fastball in the Texas League. He can run it up to the mid-90s, and there’s decent carry on the pitch that makes it play better than that. The Padres have hoped he would add some heat as he matures, and considering he’s still only the age of a typical American college junior, that could still happen. His 75-78 mph curveball and 77-79 mph slider drew most of his whiffs down and gloveside, while his mid-80s changeup acted mostly as a show pitch to lefties. Because he isn’t overthrowing, Lizarraga should have average control out of his lower three-quarters delivery, though his walks crept up at Double-A in 2025, and his improved K numbers will help his case to remain in a starting role. Without a true plus pitch, he could really use that extra velocity sooner rather than later as he knocks on the door of the Majors. He will be Rule 5-eligible for the first time next offseason.

He’s a relatively filled out 6’3” with an athletic righty delivery that put up a 4.03 ERA and 25.1/10.3 K%/BB% in 96 IP at Double-A. The curve is his best pitch and is potentially plus, but that is really his only plus attribute. The fastball sits low 90’s, the changeup is still developing, and the control is average-ish at best. He’s was only 20 in the upper minors, which makes his season more impressive, but he needs to improve his velocity, control, and/or third pitch to be more than a back end guy.

That doesn’t mean they weren’t able to find any talent. They nabbed Joseph in November 2019 when he was already closing in on his 19th birthday, and he wasn’t able to make his pro debut until 2021. He spent three years either in the Florida Complex League or with Single-A Augusta until 2024, when he managed to pitch his way from High-A Rome to Double-A Mississippi. It’s not difficult to figure out what Joseph, 24 for all of the 2025 season, is all about. He’s a two-pitch-only reliever who offers power and more power. His fastball sat at 98 mph in 2024 and touched triple digits, missing bats at a 36 percent clip thanks to good ride up in the zone. He unfurled his slider, topping out at 89 mph, more than his fastball and it’s easy to see why: The nasty breaking ball produced a 45 percent miss rate last year, according to Synergy. The one thing that has held Joseph back has been his control, and he enters 2025 with a career 5.9 BB/9 walk rate to go along with his 12.2 K/9 rate. He found the zone a bit more consistently to start the year, which enabled him to reach Double-A for the first time, but there’s a reason why the Braves didn’t put him on the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft and why he wasn’t taken. It’s clear his stuff would be good for the backend of a bullpen, but he won’t see any high leverage situations unless he can improve his command.

That’s taking nothing away from Seth Johnson, who's likely to impact the Phillies' big league staff in 2025, the bigger name who came to the Phillies in last year’s Gregory Soto deal with the Orioles. But Chace, signed back in 2019 for $225,000 out of Venezuela, made a huge impression with his new organization in six post-trade starts thanks to his electric stuff that missed a ton of bats while throwing more strikes, allowing him to touch Double-A for the first time. With a strong and compact 6-foot-1 frame, Chace reminds some of a young Cristian Javier with the makings of an elite-level repertoire. It starts with an invisible fastball that comes from a low release and a ton of ride up in the zone. It averaged 94.5 mph in 2024 and was up to 98 mph, missing a ton of bats along the way (41 percent miss rate last year). He backs it up with three secondary offerings in his sweeper, a hard cutter and a changeup the Phillies think could be above-average eventually. Chace had worked in more of a piggyback system with the Orioles, so he doesn’t have a ton of innings under his belt. There’s work to be done on his command; he’s walked 5.7 per nine heading into 2025, but his strike-throwing took a big step forward in 2024 (4.5 BB/9) and the Phillies think he has the chance to be a full-time starter in the big leagues in the future.

It visually looks like it’s swimming through the air, picking up speed before it blows by some poor minor league hitter. Saying it’s explosive would be an understatement. It’s been racking up strikeouts in the lower minors since 2021, and then he got his first shot at the upper minors to close out 2024, and he shined with a 3.66 ERA and 45.5/9.1 K%/BB% in 19.2 IP over 4 outings. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus slider and solid changeup. The one thing that can tank him is his control as he put up a 12% BB% in 80.1 IP on the season, and it’s been even worse than that in the past. It definitely might end up being the fatal flaw which puts him in the bullpen, and it prevents me from really going too crazy here, because I do love the stuff. Even with that risk, he’s an excellent upside pitching prospect who should come at a very reasonable price. This isn’t a comp, but think something like what DJ Herz did this year.

I’m not sure it’s a great thing for his fantasy value as it will be easy for him to just get stuck in the bullpen. But I like his profile enough to still crack this list on the change he can work his way into the rotation. He’s a big boy at 6’3” but the delivery is pretty damn athletic for his size. He also has really good stuff with a mid 90’s fastball, a potentially plus curve, and a solid changeup. It all resulted in a 3.99 ERA with a 31.3/6.7 K%/BB% in 103.2 IP split between High-A and Double-A (he was just as good at each level). I do think his selection dooms him to the bullpen unfortunately, but on his own merits, he’s a pretty interesting pitching prospect. – 2025 Projection: 3/3.98/1.31/65 in 65 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2582781456953642,0.32450331125827814,0.33112582781456956,0.2980132450331126,29.95,,,,20.724346076458755,1,0.25,16.061368209255534,25.088978873239437,1.0,1–2 yr,0.8944444000000011,39.266667199999986,40.0,29.889193741971827,38.94444400000001,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,23.461804023887318,sa3015414,playerId

It took a little while for him to gain traction, making his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2021, then spending two seasons with Single-A Clearwater, but things really started to click in 2024. He topped 100 innings pitched for a season for the first time and finished the year in Double-A, earning a spot on the organization’s 40-man roster as a result. Cabrera took a big step forward in 2024, starting with showing he can be durable with an increased workload despite his slight frame. He also has tweaked his arsenal to give him more weapons behind his two- and four-seamer, a heater that averaged almost 94 mph and topped out at around 96 last year. His 81-82 mph sweeper improved, missing bats at a 36 percent rate and grades out nearly as well as his plus changeup, averaging 86.6 mph last year while eliciting a 49 percent miss rate. He added a shorter, harder cutter, up into the upper 80s. A solid athlete on the mound, Cabrera repeats his delivery well and has a history of finding the strike zone, with a career 2.9 BB/9 rate heading into the 2025 season. He’s trending in the right direction, with more confidence he can be a starter long-term.

He reached Double-A in 2024 and was added to the 40-man roster but struggled to build on that in 2025, landing on the 60-day injured list with a shoulder issue, then getting designated for assignment in early December. The Phillies decided his upside was worth acquiring, getting him in return for Minor League pitcher Tommy McCollum at the end of the Winter Meetings. Curet’s calling card is his powerful fastball. His electric heater was still sitting in the mid-to-upper 90s and touched 99 mph after his return from the IL in 2025, featuring life up in the zone that can generate a lot of swing-and-miss despite him throwing it more than 60% of the time. His upper-80s breaking ball is another effective weapon, even moreso when hitters are geared up for his fastball and get gloveside movement instead. He’s also shown the ability to land that pitch for strikes. Perhaps the most interesting development is his changeup, which helped him find success in Montgomery and could round out a full starter’s pitch mix. But the stuff is not the question with Curet, nor is his physical ability to start. The issue is his command. He improved his strike-throwing in 2024, lowering his walk rate to 4.5 per nine, but that tracked back up to 5.0 per nine in 2025. That could eventually mean a move to the bullpen, where he has the power stuff to potentially be a high-leverage arm.

He combines the heat with a plus slider. He’s been dominating the lower minors since 2021, so it was a big deal to see him keep up the production at Double-A where he put up a 1.75 ERA with a 35.9/10.7 K%/BB% in 25.2 IP. The control is below average and he lacks a good third pitch, so it definitely looks like a reliever profile right now, but he can be an elite high leverage one. He could also very well be a short outing, two times through the order starter.

He has thrived since arriving in full-season ball in mid-2023, logging a 2.55 ERA with 155 strikeouts in 116 2/3 innings between two Class A stops. After shoulder weakness cost him most of the first two months of last season, he went 41 2/3 consecutive frames without allowing an earned run from in the final two months. Monegro added a mid-80s slider/cutter in 2023 and it added depth and became his best pitch last year, though he fell in love with it so much that he used it 44 percent at the time. His four-seam fastball ranges from 92-96 mph early in games, but it loses velocity and lacks good shape, so he has begun using a low-90s two-seamer more often. His upper-70s curveball once ranked as the best in the system but has regressed since he started favoring his slider, while his improving upper-80s splitter/changeup is becoming an effective chase pitch. Though Monegro has size and athleticism in his favor and has toned down his delivery while improving his control, there are questions about whether he can survive as a long-term starter. He pitches backwards because his fastballs don't have much movement or deception, so he needs to find more life or add velocity as he continues to fill out his 6-foot-4 frame. If he can't, he'll probably be a slider-heavy reliever, and those concerns contributed to the Red Sox not protecting him on the 40-man roster during the offseason.

He checks a hell of a lot of boxes with size (6’4”, 180 pounds), mid 90’s velocity, diverse pitch mix, nasty secondaries, and excellent production. He put up a 2.73 ERA with a 30.8/9.8 K%/BB% in 66 IP at High-A. He has an explosive righty delivery with a mid 90s 4-seamer, 2-seamer, a nasty change, and 2 good breaking balls in his slider and curve. He’s not a finished product as he has to continue to refine his control/command and all of his secondaries, plus he hasn’t thrown that many innings in his career (76 IP was a career high this year), but all of that is way over factored into his price. He’s a pretty special talent who has done nothing but dominate for the past two years when he’s been on the mound. If he keeps it up at Double-A, his price should take a big jump in 2025.

He worked just 23 innings in his first three years as a pro because of the pandemic shutdown in 2020 and elbow inflammation in 2022, but he opened eyes by pushing his fastball to 100 mph when he pitched briefly in August 2022. His power stands out more than his finesse, so he has spent most of the last two seasons in the bullpen. Santa's lightning-fast arm generates fastballs that reach triple digits with riding action, and he'll work in the mid-90s and touch 98 mph even when he dials his velocity back to throw more strikes. His tight mid-80s slider gives him a solid second pitch, while his upper-70s curveball offers more depth but is harder for him to control. He hasn't had much success with a mid-80s changeup that sinks and fades, though he's showing improved feel for his cambio as he uses it more often in 2025. Santa carried a 15 percent walk rate through his first four pro seasons while demonstrating well-below-average control and command. He continually fell behind in counts and got hit hard when he didn't locate his power stuff well. He has provided consistent strikes at the start of this season, though he still profiles as more of a reliever than a starter.

Facing Rule 5 eligibility this offseason, the 6-foot-2 right-hander has exploded on the scene with killer stuff and improved control, aiding the belief that he could be a starter and solidifying his place as one of the most electric arms in the San Diego system. Mendez has ramped up his four-seam fastball to touch 100 mph at times this season, and even when he sits more in the 95-98 mph range, there is still explosive life up in the zone that he’s used to blow past low-level bats. His mid-80s slider plays off that well, breaking late and just in time to fool hitters who were sitting on the heater. Lefties have just as much of a problem with the breaking ball as righties with half-hearted swings once they realize they’ve been fooled. That’s needed because while Mendez has an upper-80s changeup, it’s too firm to do more than simply change speeds. Mendez went from walking 14.9 percent of his batters faced to getting that number into single digits this summer, a very promising trendline for such a hard thrower. The lack of a true third pitch brings along its own relief risk, but with the quality of his two best offerings, he’d be a safe bet to thrive in a shorter role too. Having turned 23 in July, Mendez could be a Major League option in any capacity by next season if the stuff and control continue to hold.

He made some mechanical adjustments at the end of that season that paid off with a breakout last year between that level and Double-A. He led the system in wins (11) and strikeouts (138 in 110 1/3 innings), pitched in the Futures Game and claimed a spot on the the Rangers' 40-man roster. Santos' fastball added a couple of ticks of velocity in 2024, sitting at 94-96 mph and maxing out at 98 with natural cut and ride. He also tightened his mid-80s slider into a legitimate plus offering that he can throw by hitters in the zone or get them to chase. His mid-80s changeup isn't as reliable as his other two pitches, but it plummets at the plate when it's working right. Santos is just 6 feet tall and lacks physicality, but he's athletic and provides plenty of strikes from a flat approach angle. He surrendered eight homers in 10 Double-A starts, mostly on heaters that he didn't locate high enough in the zone. Once he refines his fastball command and changeup consistency, he could be a mid-rotation starter.

He has big stuff with a plus to double plus mid 90’s fastball that misses bats and has a great movement profile. The slider is above average and it plays up because of his good control/command over it. And while he doesn’t go to the changeup that often, it flashes as a really good pitch. It all led to a 3.67 ERA with a 30.1/7.4 K%/BB% in 110.1 IP split between High-A and Double-A. The ERA spiked to 4.89 at Double-A, but the 3.63 xFIP and 29.5/7.3 K%/BB% shows he got unlucky. As is, he can be a solid #3/4 starter with good K rates and a good WHIP, but if he can develop his changeup more and/or take his control up to double plus levels, he can beat that projection. I like him a ton relative to perceived value. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.81/1.22/175 in 168 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.923728813559322,0.847457627118644,0.6313559322033898,0.9322033898305084,83.9,92.0,,91.66666666666666,66.39839034205231,3,0.75,73.98697183098591,80.43044014084506,0.45,0–1 yr,-2.0388889,74.4666668,56.25,81.44413206225353,33.75,0.6305,Mixed,57.73069278801409,sa3015952,playerId

He had his best season yet in 2025, compiling a 2.59 ERA with 64 strikeouts in 48 2/3 innings between two Class A stops, though Tampa Bay declined to protect him on its 40-man roster. The White Sox plucked him in the Rule 5 Draft at the Winter Meetings and must keep him on their active big league roster throughout 2026, or else place him on waivers and offer him back to the Rays for half of his $100,000 selection price. Alberto's electric arm made him a prime Rule 5 target. He relies extensively on a fastball that parks at 96-98 mph and reaches 101 with natural cutting action, and when it's at its best, hitters can't stop chasing it out of the zone. He backs it up with a mid-80s slider that features sweeping life. Alberto's 6-foot-8 build, his low three-quarters arm slot and the angle and extension he creates makes him even more difficult to hit. He has only worked 172 1/3 innings as a pro and his control and command still have a long way to go, but he has closer upside. He's not really ready for the Majors, so Chicago will break him in gently as it tries to hold on to him.

He reached 99 mph when he reached full-season ball in 2023 but blew out his elbow in late July and had Tommy John surgery in December. After rehabbing all of last year, he'll be ready to return to the mound at the beginning of this season. Before he got hurt, Maldonado was sitting at 95-97 mph with late hop and some armside run on his fastball. His 82-85 mph slider was more unhittable, generating a 54 percent swing-and-miss rate against Single-A hitters. He didn't show much feel for his fading upper-80s changeup, which was too firm and rarely found the strike zone. Maldonado's compact arm action hides the ball from hitters, making him even tougher to hit. He needs time to figure out his control and command and very well could end up in the bullpen, but he'd have closer upside if he does. At least 50 pounds heavier than his listed weight of 170, he'll have to stay on top of his conditioning.

Perhaps that’s why some teams didn’t consider Herrera when the 2021 international signing period opened. The Rockies were willing to think outside the box and bring the smallish lefty with the funky mechanics into the organization; initial progress was slow. Herrera spent two years in the Dominican Summer League and one in the Arizona Complex League, but he started taking off in 2024, pitching his way from Single-A Fresno to High-A Spokane, where he finished things off with three perfect innings during the team’s championship run. He tacked on 10 strong appearances in the Dominican Winter League. Used only as a reliever, Herrera relies largely on his fastball-slider combination to go right after hitters. His fastball sits around 95 mph and touches 97 and it comes from a low three-quarters arm slot, an upshoot heater that has carry above the barrel that gets a lot of swing-and-miss. He can get too fastball-reliant and will have to keep learning to trust his 84 mph slider. It's a pitch he has improved by more consistently staying on top of; it flashes better than average while dropping below barrels. He actually has feel for a changeup with depth, but he doesn’t throw it much. Herrera pounded the strike zone during his time with Fresno, but he wasn’t as sharp with Spokane. He’s made adjustments before, so there’s confidence he’ll be able to become another legitimate big league bullpen piece for the Rockies.

He signed for the largest bonus ($350,000) the Yankees gave to a pitcher in their 2020-21 international class, then opened eyes in his U.S. debut in 2023, when he was the best pitching prospect in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League. He looked great in two shutout innings against the Blue Jays during Spring Breakout last March, but shoulder issues restricted him to just 12 1/3 frames during the regular season. When healthy, Lalane demonstrates the potential for three plus pitches with possibly control to match. His fastball can sit at 93 mph and touch 97, though it could use more armside run and carry to keep it off barrels against more advanced hitters. He has advanced feel for a mid-80s changeup that fades and sinks, while he's still learning to harness a sweeping 78-82 mph slider. The 6-foot-7 Lalane inherited size and athleticism from his father, and he does a fine job of keeping his long limbs in sync to repeat this delivery and pound the strike zone. His big frame offers some natural extension, and his low release height provides extra deception. While he has a huge ceiling, he also worked just 123 2/3 innings -- and just six above Rookie ball -- in his first four years as a pro and will be Rule 5 Draft-eligible after this season.

It was a completely lost season. This is just the life of a pitching prospect, and it’s why rookie ball pitchers are some of my least favorite prospects to go after. There is just so much that can go wrong. But when you play the rookie ball pitcher game, you know what you are getting into, so the hope is that he can come back completely healthy in 2025 and immediately get the hype rolling again. Here was my blurb for him in the 2024 Top 1,000, and nothing has really changed assuming full health: “Rookie ball pitchers aren’t my favorite to go after, but if you are going to go after one, a 6’7”, 211 pound lefty with good stuff and good numbers isn’t a bad choice. Lalane put up a 36.6%/4.5% K%/BB% in 21.2 IP in stateside rookie ball with 3 potentially plus pitches (fastball, breaking ball, changeup). He only reached 4 IP in one outing, and the fastball sits in the low to mid 90’s, so there is a long way to go, but if you squint hard enough, you can see a CC Sabathia starter pack here. Here’s to hoping he can pack on 130 pounds of pure Captain Crunch to fulfill his destiny.” ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.28/165 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.25274725274725274,0.5494505494505495,0.23076923076923073,0.2967032967032967,33.76,61.904761904761905,0.0,81.81818181818181,20.120724346076457,4,1.0,34.79117127004451,34.120909944515574,0.47750000000000004,2–4 yr,0.369444399999999,45.56666720000001,71.9375,35.63927306335467,31.75694399999999,0.49261249999999984,Mixed,34.774964718509615,sa3016066,playerId

He ranked second in the Minors in K/BB ratio (9.4) and third in walk rate (3 percent) among pitchers with 90 or more innings in 2024 before missing nearly four months of last season with a right calf strain. When Boston gambled by not placing him on its 40-man roster in November, the White Sox snagged him in the Rule 5 Draft at the Winter Meetings. While Paez still has below-average fastball velocity, his heater has moved from sitting at 85 mph in his pro debut to 88 in 2022 to 90 in 2023 and to 91 last year, peaking at 94. It works because of his precise command and ability to run four-seamers up in the zone or sink two-seamers at the knees. He used his solid low-80s slider more than his fastball in 2024, and it moves significantly in the opposite direction. His best pitch is his low-80s changeup, which fades and dives at the plate. Paez operates from a low three-quarters slot with a flat approach angle, adding life and deception to his offerings. He pounds the strike zone with all three of them and has uncanny feel for mixing pitches and locations. He's not very physical and his arm action may be better suited for relieving, but he could wind up as a back-of-the-rotation starter if he keeps proving himself.

K/BB is king for pitching, so that is really all you need to know for Paez to be interesting and on the radar. He has a very fun, super athletic righty delivery and 2 potentially plus secondaries (slider, change). The fastball only sits low 90’s, but there is some projection there at a relatively thin 6’1”. If his fastball ticks up, there is very legit explosion potential in here. I like him a ton and is one of my favorite deep pitching sleepers.

He’s moved slowly, starting in the Dominican Summer League in 2022 and heading to the Florida Complex League the following summer. His move to full-season ball didn’t go so well in 2023, but he had much better results with a return to Fort Myers last year, even though he was slowed early by a shoulder issue and then missed time with a hip impingement. A 6-foot-1 right-hander, Olivares could have four outstanding pitches if he keeps developing as he did in 2024. His fastball velocity increased from an average of 93 mph in 2023 to 95 mph this past year, touching 97 with really good riding life and armside run. He focused on developing more of a gyro slider with depth that also took a step forward, missing a ton of bats at around 87 mph. He folds in an 80 mph curve and has an interesting 86-87 mph changeup with movement that can miss bats too. Olivares did a better job last year of finding the strike zone, but he needs to improve his control and command, especially struggling with landing his curve and changeup in the zone. There could be more strikeouts to come if he can refine that and his overall pitch execution as he'll be 22 for all of the 2025 season.

Signed for $75,000 out of the Dominican Republic at age 18 in January 2021, he struck out 32 percent of the batters he faced in his first four pro seasons while climbing from Rookie ball to Triple-A. He led the Minors in opponents average (.163) while ranking third in strikeouts (171 in 130 1/3 innings) and sixth in K rate (31 percent) last year. Ullola's electric fastball can be unhittable, parking at 92-96 mph and peaking at 98 with a flat approach angle and tremendous carry up in the zone. He sharpened his mid-80s slider and threw more strikes with it in 2024, giving him a solid second offering. His low-80s curveball has more depth but isn't as devastating or reliable, while his upper-80s changeup has its moments but lacks consistent movement. Ullola has a quick arm and gets down the well, creating premium extension with a low-release height. He's athletic and his delivery isn't glaringly effortful, but he never has provided regular strikes and his 14 percent walk rate last year represented his career best.

He spent two seasons in the Dominican Summer League but has taken off in the past two seasons stateside. Arronde particularly flew onto the radar in 2024 pitching in Single-A Columbia, where he posted a 2.94 ERA across 110 1/3 innings with a 1.02 WHIP, a 23.5% strikeout rate and a 7.3% walk rate. With some strength now in his 6-foot-3 frame, Arronde’s velocity has steadily increased and sits 93-94 mph. But he can lose velocity late in the year as he struggles to keep weight on, thus leading to more hard contact on the pitch. What makes Arronde so interesting is his low-to-mid-80s split-finger changeup, a plus pitch that disappears under bats at the last second. He can land it for strikes, generate weak contact and get swing-and-miss on it. Arronde is also working on a low 80s slider that has a chance to be average or above. His clean delivery from a high three-quarters slot lends itself to throwing strikes. Arronde gets high marks for his tenacity and competitiveness on and off the mound. He’s still young with more strength needed and more development to go, but the split gives him an interesting profile as someone to keep an eye on. If his third pitch improves, he has potential as a back-end starter, but the splitter would certainly play in the bullpen.

He didn’t make a full-season debut until 2023 when he split the season between Single-A Lake Elsinore and High-A Fort Wayne, finishing with solid numbers (3.84 ERA, 99 strikeouts in 98 1/3 innings). He wasn’t added to the 40-man roster that offseason when Rule 5-eligible, however, because of his distance from the Majors. Baez enjoyed his big breakout last year, winning Padres Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors after posting a 2.99 ERA and a 1.09 WHIP with 109 strikeouts in 26 1/3 innings between Fort Wayne and Double-A San Antonio, and San Diego added him to the 40-man in November. His success continued with San Antonio in 2025 and he was leading the Texas League in ERA, WHIP and batting average against when he was included in the prospect package sent to the A’s in return for Mason Miller and JP Sears at the Trade Deadline. The 6-foot-3 right-hander has gained velocity steadily in his years as a pro and has touched as high as 99 mph this season. He typically sits around 94 mph, working north-south with the pitch while getting most of his whiffs up and to the armside. He played off that with a 76-79 mph curveball that could have more slurvish tendencies, but at its best, it snapped downward to fool batters sitting on the high heat and it had produced a 47 percent miss rate at the time of the trade. He also utilizes an 83-86 mph split-change to miss bats, but it stands out more for its separation than movement profile. Baez took a major jump in workload but didn’t let his control improvements suffer. That certainly helps his starting chances, as does his 50.1 percent ground-ball rate from 2024. He’s still only 22, but with his place on the roster now set, the A’s (never afraid to move guys quickly) could try to see what it looks like in the big leagues in a relief role to ease him in.

Pitching 84 innings for Single-A Dunedin in ‘23, Rojas posted a 3.75 ERA with 82 strikeouts and 32 walks. He followed that up with a 2.59 ERA in ‘24, topping out at High-A, that included 69 strikeouts in 62 2/3 innings. While a shoulder issue landed him on the IL early in 2024 and an abdominal strain delayed his '25 debut until the end of May this year, he managed to touch Triple-A for the first time, making a start the day before he was traded to the Twins in return for Louis Varland and Ty France at the Trade Deadline. Because of the injuries, we’re still yet to see what the 22-year-old left-hander looks like when he’s fully stretched out, given that his career high in innings is 84. All other signs are encouraging, though, with his fastball continuing to tick up this year, averaging 94-95 mph and touching 97 after hovering closer to 90 a couple of years ago. He’s also throwing his slider and changeup a bit harder, sitting 86-87 mph, with the former being his predominant secondary pitch. His challenge for now will be developing and maintaining a starter’s routine and carrying that top-end stuff past 100 innings. Rojas’ growth has been incremental over the years, but it’s all adding up now to one of the more intriguing left-handed pitching prospects in the Twins' system. From here, he needs to develop his routines and master everything that goes into pitching between his start days. He’s started to show that he can handle the challenge of the upper levels and if he can stay healthy, he could be ready to touch a big league rotation in 2026.

He moved full-time to the bullpen this season after going unprotected and unpicked in last year’s Rule 5 Draft and has enjoyed solid success in the new role in the upper levels. The 6-foot-1 right-hander certainly has the look of a high-energy reliever down. Pitching exclusively out of the stretch, he dips low while holding the ball behind his back and fires over-the-top. His mid-80s slider can be a beauty out of the hand. Just when it looks like Orellana is about to fire a fastball, he’ll drop in that breaking ball, which stands out more for its drop than horizontal movement, past waving batters. The fastball has solid velocity in the 93-96 mph range, touching 98, so he’ll sneak heaters past batters too. But the slider has been his primary pitch in ’25. A 79-81 mph curveball gives a slower breaking look. Orellana’s move to the bullpen was a long time coming after he struggled to keep his walk rate below 12 percent earlier in his career. His approach is unorthodox to spice things up in any relief corps, and he’s made New York’s 40-man decision tougher this year with the way he’s taken to his new role. That said, he’s still more likely to fill a middle relief role than a high-leverage one in the bigs. Last Prospect 24 R.J.

Following his brief pro debut, he blew out his elbow and had Tommy John surgery that October. He has displayed some of the best stuff in the system since returning in 2023, though he has struggled with his control and command. McDougal's fastball sits in the upper 90s and touches 100 mph, though it features more downhill plane than life and can get hit hard when he doesn’t locate it well. He generates high spin rates on two different breaking balls. His upper-70s downer curveball can make hitters look silly, but it has so much downer break that he rarely lands it in the zone, while his upper-80s slider is more reliable if less devastating. While McDougal's upper-80s changeup has some fade, he doesn't trust it or have much success with it. He lacks a polished delivery and doesn't repeat it well, which leads to below-average command of his fastball and control of his secondary pitches. His repertoire and lack of finesse may make him better suited for a relief role, though his mid-rotation starter ceiling will keep him in the rotation for a while.

After he pitched two seasons at Northwestern and briefly in the MLB Draft League, the Red Sox made him a 19th-round pick in 2021. He recovered from Tommy John surgery that cost him the entire 2023 season to log a 3.58 ERA with 137 strikeouts in 120 2/3 innings between Double-A and Triple-A in 2025, earning a spot on the 40-man roster. While Uberstine's fastball parks at 93 mph and tops out at 96, it works because he can backspin four-seamers with carry up at the letters. He also uses a two-seamer with a tick less velocity that he can run and sink down in the zone, but it's not nearly as effective. His fading mid-80s changeup grades as average and is more reliable than his low-80s slider and upper-80s cutter. Uberstine utilizes a nearly sidearm slot and low release height to create angle and deception with his offerings. He has no problem throwing strikes but must locate his pitches well because he can't overpower hitters. He doesn't have a huge ceiling but is on the verge of reaching Fenway Park.

After he performed well there and against older hitters in the inaugural season of the MLB Draft League, he signed for a well-over-slot $850,000 as a fifth-rounder. The youngest player (age 19) on Canada’s 2023 World Baseball Classic team, he reached Double-A shortly after turning 21 last summer. He returned to Frisco for 2025 and put up big strikeout numbers before being dealt to the D-backs at the Trade Deadline in the deal for Merrill Kelly. Bratt hasn’t added as much velocity as hoped since turning pro, but his low-90s fastball that tops out at 95 is still effective because it rides well up in the zone and he can command it where he wants. He plays off the heater with a low-80s slider with nice depth, a mid-80s cutter, an upper-70s curveball and a mid-80s changeup. The slide piece shows the most promise, and mixing in the cutter gives him a bridge pitch to work off that. Bratt’s athletic delivery features little effort and allows him to provide constant strikes. He can move his pitches around the zone and can read hitters’ swings to determine how to get them out. His craftiness and mound presence stand out more than his pure stuff, giving him a high floor as a back-of-the-rotation starter.

That hasn't really materialized, but he's learned how to use what he has to find success, and after spending two seasons with Single-A Modesto, he pitched his way from High-A to Double-A in 2024. Morales can bring as many as five pitches to the table, all coming from a simple and repeatable delivery that points to a future as an innings-eating starter; his 149 innings in 2024 landed him in the top 10 among all Minor League pitchers. It's not loud stuff, with a fastball that sat 92 mph, but he does command it well. His changeup might be the one pitch that has a chance to be an out pitch, thrown in the low 80s and missing bats at a 41 percent clip last year, according to Synergy. He has a whole array of breaking stuff, from a slower curve to a sweeper that can be effective, and he also has a cutter-like pitch that can have some gyro-like slider tendencies to it. Not only did Morales lower his walk rate considerably in 2024, his overall command within the zone improved as well, showing the ability to use the outer edges of the plate more effectively. His ceiling might be that of a durable workhorse in the back part of a rotation, but he will still be only 22 for most of the 2025 season.

The Tigers selected him in the 14th round that summer and signed him for $125,000, making him the first Charleston Southern player drafted in three years. Petit immediately moved into a relief role in the pros and has remained there since. He pitched well in Double-A in 2024 but was left unprotected and unpicked in that December's Rule 5 Draft. After a strong 2025 campaign that saw him reach Triple-A, Petit was once again left unprotected, but this time the Rockies made him the top pick of the Rule 5. Standing at 6-foot-8, Petit is a tremendous presence on the mound. He doesn’t get big extension out of that frame, instead using his height to create a steep downward plane leading to solid groundball rates. There is some velocity here, touching 98 mph while sitting 94-96, and he's worked to generate a bit more heat. Petit’s 83-85 mph gyro slider is much better at generating swing-and-miss and chase low in the zone with strong depth, and the Rockies think it's the kind of breaking ball that should play in Coors Field. He can tunnel his 86-89 mph changeup well enough off the fastball with just enough velocity separation for it to be effective. Petit has shown the ability to get righties and lefties out at the upper levels, and he was able to get his walk rate back down in 2025 to 3.0 per nine after seeing it creep up in 2024 (4.1 BB/9). He'll get his chance to stick with the Rockies, who see him as a potential bulk reliever.

His express train to the big leagues was derailed by an elbow injury and subsequent Tommy John surgery that kept him off a competitive mound for all of 2023 and 2024. His highly anticipated return to action in the Arizona Fall League last year did not disappoint, and there was little rust as the right-hander displayed his elite-level stuff over the course of six outings. During his time in the Fall League, Painter showed that in many ways he was the same premium prospect with a legitimate four-pitch mix, albeit with a little twist. His plus heater was touching 100 mph again and averaged 97 in the fall with plenty of ride up in the zone, he dropped in his low-80s curve for strikes and his above-average changeup got better as the fall season wore on. The new wrinkle for the 6-foot-7 right-hander was a harder slider with cutter-like action thrown in the upper 80s, replacing what had been more of a sweeper. Painter misses bats with all four offerings, and while his fastball command was understandably a bit scattered at times given his long layoff, he continued to astound with his ability to pound the strike zone thanks to a simple and repeatable delivery. Even with all the time away, Painter will be just 22 years old for the 2025 season and ready to pick up where he left off before the injury.

Just seeing that he was able to ramp up and start pitching in games without getting re-injured is a big first step that we can cross off our worry list this off-season. But he’s also proving he is nearly 100% healthy with the plus to double plus fastball sitting mid to upper 90’s. Like we saw with Shane Baz, it seems that breaking ball crispness and consistency can be something that lags behind after Tommy John, but long term the slider projects as plus and he also throws a lesser used curve and change that could end up plus pitches in their own right. If you ignore the injury, he’s basically a perfect pitching prospect with size, athleticism, velocity, double plus fastball, plus secondary, diverse pitch mix, and plus control. And now that we’ve seen him back on the mound and thriving, the injury risk is a bit lessened. He moves back into my top spot among pitching prospects after his AFL performance, but it’s still a tight race with Noah Schultz, who I absolutely love. It was announced the Phillies plan to slow play him in 2025, which his ETA in the majors around July, and if that helps keep him healthy, avoiding the end of season dilemma for a contending team where he’s at his innings limit, I’m all for it. – 2025 Projection: 6/3.68/1.20/86 in 80 IP Prime Projection: 15/2.95/0.91/225 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5254237288135593,0.3644067796610169,0.7372881355932204,0.5169491525423728,52.64,100.0,100.0,97.87234042553192,98.18913480885311,4,1.0,99.04704824692837,68.88246688642494,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.0249999999999986,86.29999999999998,85.0,62.56174006592748,15.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,60.16278302966737,sa3017880,playerId

Since signing for an over-slot $1,269,500 as a third-rounder, he has retained his feel for spin while adding velocity and losing control. He posted a 3.05 ERA at High-A last year with the best average-against (.181) and second-highest strikeout percentage (30 percent) among Midwest League pitchers with at least 90 innings, but he also had the worst walk percentage (17 percent). Heubeck now operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that reaches 97 with huge induced vertical break that creates significant carry. Both his upper-70s downer curveball and his tighter mid-80s slider can be plus pitches that work against both lefties and righties when he lands them for strikes, which he hasn't done consistently in pro ball. He also has a mid-80s changeup with fade and sink that could be an average pitch if he learns to harness it. Heubeck has a clean arm action and an athletic delivery that should be conducive to at least average control. He sometimes overspins his breaking balls and needs to find a better balance between trying to create nasty stuff and throwing strikes. The Dodgers still think he could develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter, even if takes longer than they expected.

Signed for a well-over-slot $1.5 million, he spent his first two years as a pro in Rookie ball before pitching well at two Class A levels in 2023. He starred at another new event in 2024, pitching four shutout innings with eight strikeouts against the Blue Jays in a Spring Breakout game, but rarely looked that sharp at Double-A before his season ended in July with biceps inflammation. The Yankees had Selvidge lean heavily on his best pitch last season, when he threw his sweeping low-80s slider nearly half the time, and he'll also mix in an upper-80s cutter as well. That usage and his biceps injury may have contributed to the loss of a tick or two of fastball velocity, as he operated at 91-94 and peaked at 96, and his heater straightens out and gets hit when he doesn't locate it up in the zone. His mid-80s changeup has impressive fade but won't be a reliable option until he can land it for strikes consistently. While Selvidge's walk rate jumped from 7 percent in his first three pro seasons to 11 percent in 2024, he has the athleticism and clean delivery to have at least average control and command. He earns praise for his mound presence and has a higher floor than most of New York's starting pitching prospects. He's a good bet to become a No. 4 or 5 starter, and his slider alone would make him a useful lefty reliever.

His development since has been slow and inconsistent, and he returned for a full season at High-A in 2024 after struggling there at the end of ‘23. Last year, Mozzicato posted a 3.45 ERA across 101 2/3 innings, limiting batters to a .203 average. But he walked 62 batters while his strikeout rate fell to 21.3%. Mozzicato’s best pitch remains his plus low-80s curveball with downer movement. He’s always been able to spin the ball well, but the command was not consistent in 2024. It doesn’t help that his fastball velocity continues to fluctuate as Mozzicato struggles to keep weight and strength on during the season. His heater was 87-90 mph and was out of the zone too often in '24, but it does have some high vert with a good approach angle. He has increased the usage of an average circle changeup, but it doesn’t have a ton of velo separation from his fastball. If the heater is performing well one night, so is his changeup, and vice versa. Mozzicato’s numbers weren’t bad in 2024, but the Royals worked with him a lot on some under-the-surface aspects after the season so he can be better set up for success at the higher level. The priority was reworking his long arm action that really hindered not only his command but also his velocity, officials believed. Specific drills helped him shorten up the arm stroke, and he was having better results by Spring Training. But Mozzicato will have to show it in games and see if his control issues can be ironed out because that and the low velocity will hold him back from starter projection. They looked better at High-A Quad Cities to open 2025 but regressed again after a promotion to Double-A.

High School, Kudrna won Kansas baseball Gatorade Player of the Year honors as a senior as his Draft stock climbed. He was a Louisiana State commit but decided to go pro when the Royals selected him No. 43 overall in the 2021 Draft and gave him an over-slot $3 million. He’s had a steady climb in the Minor Leagues, reaching Double-A in 2024, his third full season of pro ball. Kudrna threw 115 1/3 innings between two levels last year, with a 3.49 ERA at High-A (14 starts) before the jump to Double-A, where he got hit around a bit more and posted a 5.32 ERA in nine appearances (eight starts). Kudrna throws from a three-quarters arm slot and has always had solid strikeout and walk rates. His four-seam fastball sits at 92-95 mph, a few ticks down from his peak prep velocity, but he can flash in the upper 90s at times. He’s bigger and stronger than he was in high school, but there still might be a bit more in the tank. The pitch was more vulnerable to slug at Double-A in ‘24, likely a result of command. Kudrna’s best secondary pitch is his changeup, a plus to double-plus pitch that plays well off his fastball. He also features a mid-80s gyro slider with late bite, and consistency with the pitch was his biggest offseason focus. Kudrna introduced a two-seam fastball into his repertoire in 2024, a pitch that has the same velocity as his four-seam but with more run -- and something he’s very comfortable throwing. Kudrna’s delivery is good overall, although the Royals targeted his hip-shoulder separation as needing to be more consistent, and he focused on that this past offseason too. His physical frame makes him a durable and reliable rotation arm, projecting as a back-end starter, although his velocity might tick up more if he’s in the bullpen. He needs to adjust a little more to a higher level, so he’ll head back to Double-A this year with a chance for a Triple-A promotion later in the season depending on performance.

When Solometo reached Double-A at age 20 in 2023, it seemed like he was on a faster track to Pittsburgh. He got derailed back in Double-A in 2024 when his velocity dropped considerably, landing on the development list to work on getting his stuff back, then missed nearly all of the 2025 season because of shoulder issues. For Solometo to have success, he’ll need to get back to his fastball sitting in the low 90s instead of topping out at 90 mph like it was for much of 2024. With a funky delivery and sink, the pitch can play up when the velocity increases, and while there were encouraging signs in pitching camp and in early live BP sessions in Spring Training, pitching in the 92-94 mph range, his shoulder problem kept him from building off of that. Everything else plays off of that, with his mid-80s slider missing more bats and his 84-85 mph changeup that kills spin being more effective with more velocity separation from his heater. There are a lot of moving parts to Solometo’s delivery, much of which works to his advantage in terms of deception but can make it a little more difficult for him to be on time and throw strikes consistently. The silver lining from 2024 might be that Solometo had to try to compete with a below-average fastball and learned to induce weak contact more, with the hopes that the regained velocity could come back and stick when he’s healthy.

There was some hope that switching to a two-seamer with sink would help his overall command, but that hasn’t been the case, though he does get a good amount of groundball outs. His changeup is still his second-best pitch, flashing above average with good fade and some bat-missing ability, and his breaking ball is now more of a hard power curve thrown with slider velocity, in the 83-86 mph range. In the second half of the 2023 season, Urena cut his walk rate down, leading some to hope that the two-seamer switch was working. He was back up to walking 6.3 per nine, though he had a couple of better outings in July before he was shut down following a comebacker off of his foot. He needs to find a true out pitch, and most feel he’ll end up in a bullpen eventually, but the Angels don’t want to limit the 21-year old’s innings just yet.

San Diego sent him stateside for eight appearances in the Arizona Complex League to begin his age-18 season when he was dealt to the Nationals as part of the Juan Soto blockbuster. Susana saw time with Single-A Fredericksburg after the trade, returned there for all of 2023 and then opened 2024 back in the Carolina League. He had an 8.89 ERA with 19 walks in 26 1/3 innings through his first three starts of last season but quickly course-corrected with a 2.79 ERA, 123 strikeouts and 29 walks in 77 1/3 innings over his final 18 starts, 10 of which came with High-A Wilmington. The 6-foot-6 righty makes velocity look easy with a four-seam and a two-seam fastball that typically sit in the 98-101 mph range. He was still touching as high as 102 at times into last September. His gyro slider plays really well off the fastball with good, late vertical drop to elude bats, and he can backfoot lefties as well as yank away from righties. His low-90s changeup is a distant third pitch, which enabled opposite-side batters to post better splits (.751 OPS vs. .516). Starting primarily from the stretch, it doesn’t look like Susana is overthrowing to get the heat, though his zealous follow-through adds flair. He focused a ton on developing a repeatable delivery in between outings in 2024, and the improvements in that regard allowed his control rates to improve drastically as the season wore on, though they've regressed again in 2025. There will always be talk of a future as a closer, but Susana is looking more than ever like a potential impact MLB starter.

After a rough start, he caught fire, putting up a 2.79 ERA with a 39.4/9.3 K%/BB% in his final 77.1 IP split between Single-A and High-A. The Greene comp is actually extremely on point for the similarly sized, 6’6”, 235 pound Susana with an upper 90’s fastball that doesn’t get enough movement, a double plus slider, below average control, and a developing splitter. The improvements that Greene made this season (turning the splitter into a legit third weapon and improving his fastball movement) are the same improvements Susana has to make as he continues to climb the ladder. He also needs to continue to improve his control/command, as he can start to look a big relievery at times. There is still plenty of risk here, but there is legit top of the rotation upside, and he could have a soft landing spot as an elite closer. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.55/1.26/187 in 165 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9139072847682119,0.9867549668874173,0.152317880794702,0.9139072847682119,76.49,88.46153846153845,71.42857142857143,95.55555555555556,85.71428571428572,4,1.0,84.30586080586082,79.22555128205128,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.9777777999999984,73.73333359999998,85.0,76.89716542461538,15.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,64.10039116107691,sa3018808,playerId

While he’s never been the prospect to wow evaluators with velocities and pitch movement metrics, Perez has tremendous feel for his pitches, creating a prospect who is greater than the sum of his individual tools. Perez broke out in 2023, posting a 2.72 ERA over 49 2/3 innings in the Complex League, and he followed that up with a 4.06 ERA and 86 strikeouts over 82 innings at Single-A. Perez’s profile is all about his potential floor, which right now points toward him being a back-end depth starter in the big leagues. For his ceiling to move, some of his stuff will need to tick up once more, which starts with his fastball. Perez sat 93-94 mph last season, which was an encouraging step, while showing a good feel for his 82-85 mph slider. Perez tends to live in the zone (2.0 BB/9 career), which is his greatest strength but also something that will present a challenge. As he faces more advanced hitters who know they’ll be getting pitches near the plate, can Perez adjust and miss bats? The slider will be a key piece there, as will developing a consistent changeup. Most pitchers Perez’s age have high-end stuff, but need more feel. Perez is the opposite, which makes him so unique on this list, but he needs to show he can keep living in the zone at each stop up the ladder.

The Dodgers acquired him along with Matt Gage in a February 2024 deal that sent Caleb Ferguson to New York. After struggling in Single-A last summer, Zazueta has thrived at that level with much improved command this season. Zazeuta overmatches lower-level hitters with a fastball that sits at 92-95 mph, touches 97 and arrives on a flat approach angle with plenty of carry and armside run. His advanced changeup contrasts well with his heater, working at 83-85 mph with fade and sink. His mid-80s slider moves in the opposite direction and features quality depth at its best. Not only does Zazeuta pound the strike zone, but he also commands all three of his offerings well. He shows the ability to get chases and in-zone swings-and-misses with his entire arsenal. A potential mid-rotation starter, he has plenty of room to add strength to his athletic 6-foot-3 frame, which could mean more power for his pitches in the future.

Los Angeles needed more international bonus pool money to sign Korean right-hander Hyun-Seok Jang in August 2023, so it traded Batista and fellow righty pitching prospect Maximo Martinez to the White Sox for $1 million in funds. He has pitched well at two A-ball levels since while displaying one of the system's best changeups. Batista utilizes two fastballs that operate at 92-94 mph and max out at 96, preferring sinking two-seamers down at hitters' knees to running four-seamers past them at the letters. He slings mid-80s changeups that fade and tumble, generating a lot of weak contact. He has an effective mid-80s slider that will flash some two-plane depth at its best. Batista is athletic and works from a low slot that's a tick above sidearm, creating deception without harming his ability to throw strikes. If he can add more muscle to his slender 6-foot-2 frame, he might add more velocity and boost his stuff and ceiling. He has the upside of a No. 4 starter but will need some development time to get there.

He broke into pro ball by logging a 1.42 ERA with a 60/4 K/BB ratio in 38 innings in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League in 2022. He continued to dominate in Single-A in his U.S. debut the following year, then skipped a level and held his own in Double-A last year despite a thigh injury that sidelined him for two months. Fleury's changeup has fueled his success, operating in the low 80s with fade and huge depth while deceiving both lefties and righties. It drops through the bottom of the strike zone and pairs nicely with a 90-92 mph fastball that tops out at 94 and stands out much more with its carry than its velocity. He trusts his low-80s slider more than his upper-70s curveball, though neither is as effective as his cambio or heater. Fleury makes up for a lack of physicality with athleticism and a fluid, high three-quarters delivery that he repeats well. He adds deception by getting down the mound well and creating a low-release height with quality extension. He doesn't have a high ceiling but can be a No. 4 or 5 starter if he can find a little more velocity or improve his breaking stuff.

He’s been a project on the bump ever since, even walking 20.2 percent of his batters faced in 2024 -- his first stateside campaign. But that project was rounding into terrific form in the Florida State League this summer as Aracena flipped between starting and relieving and racking up innings in his age-20 season when he was sent to the Orioles as part of the return for Gregory Soto near the Trade Deadline. Standing at 6-foot-3, the right-hander has built up velocity as he’s physically matured, and he now brings serious heat to the mound, sitting 96-99 mph with his four-seam fastball and topping out at 101 in ’25. The movement profile doesn’t quite pop, but while the heater has been more touchable than the velo would indicate, it’s still generally weak contact. The star of the show is arguably Aracena’s razor-sharp 92-94 mph cutter. It comes with plenty of heat itself but moves six more inches to the gloveside than the four-seamer and comes with some drop, often leading batters befuddled. He has the makings of an upper-80s slider with good depth too, giving him another whiff-heavy option, and a mid-80s curveball that isn’t at the same level. Aracena has barely thrown his 92-95 mph changeup in ’25 because it doesn’t offer much of a change of speeds. Entering late July, Aracena had cut his walk rate down to 13.2 percent with Single-A St. Lucie, but he still has the makings of a pitcher trying to blow his stuff past batters. Even if he has to stick in relief, the fastball/cutter combination could be stellar in the back of an MLB bullpen.

The Colombian spent his first two years as a pro in Rookie ball and most of his first three seasons as a reliever before taking a huge step forward in 2025. When pitching injuries in Los Angeles had the snowball effect of decimating the rotation at Triple-A Oklahoma City in May, Liñan was promoted from Single-A for two emergency starts. He was at High-A Great Lakes in July when the Dodgers traded him to the Nationals at the Deadline for Alex Call. Liñan has one of the best changeups in the Minors, a high-spin cambio that veers sharply down and to the right as it approaches the plate around 80 mph. It plays extremely well off his 91-94 mph fastball, which stands out more with its carry and armside run than its velocity. His tight mid-80s slider/cutter is nothing special but it consistently provides strikes. Though Liñan is just 6 feet tall, he gets down the mound well and provides plenty of extension. His low release height, as well as his changeup, also add to his deception. He's a potential back-of-the-rotation starter, though he'll need to develop a second better-than-average offering to succeed against more advanced hitters.

In between, he’s been a steady performer in the Arizona system. His 2024 campaign was put on pause when he suffered facial fractures on a foul ball hit to the Double-A Amarillo dugout, but he still managed a 4.28 ERA with 90 strikeouts in 94 2/3 innings in the Texas League before making one start for Triple-A Reno. Lin rounded out his stateside season with three Arizona Fall League starts before heading abroad for Premier12. The 5-foot-11 southpaw steps to the side and rocks a bit to begin his delivery out of the stretch with a little flair. He throws both a four-seamer and a sinker in the 90-92 mph range (occasionally touching 95-96). Without stellar velocity, he needs the different movement profiles to keep hitters off balance. He also has to locate the pitches well, because when he doesn’t, they can be crushed. But the depth of the arsenal reveals more promising offerings, like an 80-82 mph changeup that fades well off the heat and a mid-70s curveball. Both are options against righties, while a 79-82 mph sweeper is his go-to secondary against lefties. Both breaking balls play with extreme spin with the curve, in particular, averaging above 3,000 rpm at Triple-A Reno in 2025. Lin has also worked on incorporating an upper-80s cutter to keep hitters guessing further. He needs to live on the edges of the zone if he’s going to achieve whiffs because he can’t blow pitches by batters. His four-seamer has been particularly crushed in the Pacific Coast League. Lin’s outing against Japan showed he doesn’t back down from challenges, though, and he has enough offerings to make it work as a starter.

They were able to add Lara’s talent to the system for just $10,000 in June. He was 18 when he signed, a bit older for the market, but he’s moved relatively quickly since, coming to the United States for the first time in 2023 and reaching Double-A in 2024. Lara will be 22 for all of the 2025 season and remains primarily a two-pitch pitcher. His fastball backed up a little bit in 2024, averaging more around 94-95 mph and topping out at 96-97. His upper-80s slider with good spin and sweep was excellent, with a 46 percent miss rate on the pitch last year, and he threw it almost as often as his heater. There’s talk of him playing around with a changeup at some point, but the focus remains on the consistency of his two potentially plus offerings. What kind of role Lara might have long-term will come down to his ability to repeat his delivery and throw strikes. There’s definitely reliever risk here given that he walked 6.5 per nine last year (5.9/9 in his career), but the Braves don’t want to pull the plug too quickly on him starting because his stuff holds up and misses bats consistently.

After one season in the Dominican Summer League, he’s been on a fast track toward San Diego, having played for all five stateside affiliates between 2023 and ’24. In his most recent campaign, he finished with a 2.43 ERA and 64 strikeouts over 63 innings across the top three levels of the Minors. Like many Padres pitching prospects, his numbers jumped at hitter-friendly El Paso but not enough to be overly concerning. Pena cuts a thin figure at 6-foot-1, setting up out of the stretch from the first-base side of the rubber. But he generated over 7 feet of extension at Triple-A, putting himself close to the plate with dynamic stuff. He throws a pair of fastballs, both in the 94-97 mph range -- a sinker with more than 11 inches of armside run and a straighter four-seamer. He leaned on the former more at Triple-A, which makes sense given his other offering. In 2025, his most oft-used secondary is an 86-89 mph two-plane slider that he uses to get a ton of whiffs. Walks weren't a huge issue for Pena in the Minors until his extended time at Triple-A in '25. The sinker helps him run a heavy ground-ball rate. The lack of a changeup may make him a questionable fit against lefties at the top level, but the slider has served him well enough so far. He has to find more strikes if he's going to earn that MLB debut.

They landed Suarez in a familiar way, picking him up in a relatively low-profile trade while he was pitching in the complex leagues. That strategy once brought them Curtis Mead and, more famously, Junior Caminero. In November 2022, they played that card again to get Suarez and starter Marcus Johnson from the Marlins for reliever JT Chargois and infielder Xavier Edwards. The native of Cumana, Venezuela, was arguably the steadiest and most reliable arm in that season-ending Charleston rotation, but that’s not a knock on his stuff. His fastball sat in the mid-90s last season and touched 97 mph. His low-80s curveball is arguably the best hook in Tampa Bay’s system. He also throws a changeup that rounds out his arsenal. But his carrying trait, the thing that makes it all work for Suarez, is his control. With a repeatable delivery and a cool, collected mound presence, he consistently fills up the strike zone and has walked only 1.6 batters per nine innings in the Minors at an age when many starters are struggling to consistently put the ball where they want it. Suarez’s tendency to throw strikes has also helped him induce chases outside the strike zone and enough swing-and-miss to succeed. Bottom line, Suarez has performed well wherever he’s gone, from his time as a statistical standout in the Dominican Summer League at age 17 to his 23-start campaign in Single-A last year. He doesn’t have a ton of physical projection left, unlike his rotation mates, but he might have the highest floor and the highest likelihood to make it as a starter, although triceps/shoulder issues have limited him in 2025.

He led the Rookie-level Florida Complex League with 63 strikeouts in 41 2/3 innings during his U.S. debut in 2023 but missed most of last season with back inflammation. He worked just 29 2/3 innings between Rookie ball, Single-A and the Arizona Fall League, hitting triple digits with his heater but also issuing 35 walks before finding the strike zone much more regularly in 2025. Lagrange sits at 97-99 mph and reaches 102 with his fastball, and he's showing more consistent carry, armside run and command with his heater now that he's fully healthy. His sweeping 82-85 mph slider can be a well-above-average offering at its best and he's doing a better job of landing it for strikes this year. He also can turn his slider into an upper-80s cutter and has upgraded his feel for an upper-80s changeup with some fade and depth. The 6-foot-7 Lagrange doesn't create much extension in his delivery but does work from a low three-quarters slot that provides a flat approach angle. He'll never have pinpoint control but he has improved his ability to locate his arsenal this year. He has the stuff to be a frontline starter or closer and is creating much more optimism that he'll be able to reach his lofty ceiling.

He got rocked for a 9.53 ERA in his U.S. debut in 2023, then sliced that mark to 3.89 when he returned to the Rookie-level Florida Complex League last season. Similarly, he scuffled in his first taste of full-season ball last summer before looking like one of the best young arms in the Single-A Florida State League this spring. Martinez pounds the strike zone with a fastball that ranges from 91-95 mph with armside run and sink. He can spin both of his breaking pitches upward of 2,800 rpm and miss bats with both of them, doing a lot better job of throwing strikes with his upper-70s curveball than his low-80s slider. His fading mid-80s changeup is very much a work in progress. A quality athlete, Martinez gets down the mound well and creates plenty of extension that allows his pitches to get on hitters quicker than they expect. Adding strength to his projectable 6-foot-2 frame would add more power to his pitches and help him repeat his delivery more consistently. He'll need to throw more strikes to realize his upside as a No. 4 starter.

He was older, already 21 when he signed, so after getting started in the Dominican Summer League after signing, he went straight to full-season ball in 2023, starting very slowly but then figuring things out in the back end of the season. After starting and relieving with Single-A Inland Empire, he was a mainstay in High-A Tri-City’s rotation in 2024 with mixed results, though he did lead the Northwest League in innings pitched (138 2/3) and strikeouts (134). Now 24, it feels like in many ways Hurtado is still figuring out who he is as a pitcher. The 6-foot-2 right-hander can light up the radar gun, flirting with triple digits and sitting in the mid-90s with ease, throwing two-seamers with sink to get groundball outs. His slider, which he can run up into the upper-80s, has become his breaking ball – he’s all but scrapped a slower get-me-over curve – and he misses a lot of bats with it. He continues to try to find a third pitch, some kind of change-of-speed, that can work for him. Hurtado’s ability to land his two potentially plus pitches for strikes regressed in 2024 and he walked 5.3 per nine as a result. The Angels may not want to pull the plug on him starting just yet so he can work on his command and that third offering, but it’s hard not to dream about him as a sinker-slider reliever who’s throwing 100 mph-plus in shorter stints.

Focusing on pitching only for the first time, he had a pretty solid first full season of pro ball, ending the year with High-A Rome. He went back to the level to kick off 2024 and was throwing very well until he was shut down with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery at the start of June. Before the injury, Murphy’s stuff was all trending up, coming from his strong, athletic 6-foot-1 frame. His velocity had climbed back up to the low 90s, and he was throwing it with plenty of ride and high spin up in the zone. His mid-80s slider had cutting action to it and could miss bats and his slower mid-70s curve provided a different look. There had been some feel for a changeup in the past as well. A solid athlete on the mound, there’s confidence Murphy will be a solid strike-thrower in the future, with a repeatable delivery. Because of the timing of the elbow surgery, it’s likely going to be the 2026 season that he’ll be going full-tilt again, and he’ll still be just 22 years old.

That likely keeps him out for most or all of 2025, but it does give him enough of a cushion to prove he’s healthy by the end of the season and possibly into the AFL, so there could be some budding hype by this time next year assuming full health. And if he hadn’t gotten hurt, the hype could have been hitting hard already with a 1.54 ERA and 38.7/7.7 K%/BB% in 41 IP at High-A. The fastball only sits low 90’s, but it gets a ton of movement and is a plus pitch. The slider and curveball both still need refinement, but the slider in particular will flash at least plus. And the control/command is potentially plus with an extremely easy and athletic righty delivery. He’s not necessarily that in your face, upper 90’s, mountain of a man pitching prospect (6’1”) that will get no doubt elite pitching prospect love, but he’s the one who will sneak up on you real fast until he’s all of a sudden doing it against MLB hitters. The injury obviously complicates things, but I like him enough to not have it kill his value.

CC product signed with the Padres for $10,000 in August 2022. Shoulder issues limited his first full season to 40 1/3 innings between the Arizona Complex League and Single-A Lake Elsinore, but he confirmed his spot on the radar with 21 strikeouts in 17 1/3 frames in the Arizona Fall League. Nett, who dealt with elbow tightness in the summer, expanded his workload slightly to 65 innings in '24 and made 19 of his 20 appearances with High-A Fort Wayne before a cup of Double-A coffee. He made up for the lost innings with a stellar turn (1.02 ERA, 23 strikeouts in five starts) in the Puerto Rican Winter League. He had already surpassed his career high in innings pitched in his first full season in the Texas League when he was part of the four-prospect package sent to the A’s in return for Mason Miller and JP Sears at the Trade Deadline. While working around the injuries, Nett has continued to show stellar velocity, touching as high as 99 mph in the Minor Leagues last season. He typically sits 95-97 mph and gets swing-and-miss up in the zone thanks to ample carry. He also throws a tight 81-84 mph slider that ran a 38 percent whiff rate in ’24 and a sharper 90-92 mph cutter that can catch hitters off guard. He’ll mix in an upper-70s curveball with more vertical drop and he’s scrapped a low-80s splitter in favor of a much more effective 88 mph kick-change that really neutralizes lefties. Nett has some effort in his delivery, and the 2025 season (pre-trade) was the first time he’d posted a walk rate below 13 percent at any Minor League stop. Combine that with the early injury concerns, and it’s easy to think he could be a reliever eventually. But his arsenal is deep enough, and his stuff is promising enough -- when combined with strides taken this season -- to keep landing him in a starting role in the upper Minors.

The Braves took him with a compensation pick after Round 2 of that summer’s Draft, but he needed Tommy John surgery shortly after he had begun his first pro season. He had a solid return to the mound with High-A Rome in 2024, logging 72 total innings for the year. Though he’s just 6-foot and has that impressive relief resume in college, the Braves are continuing to give Burkhalter the chance to start. That’s because he now has a viable four-pitch mix and the ability to land all of them in the strike zone. His velocity was back upon his return, up to 98 mph with a fastball that features good carry. A cutter that he can get up to about 91-92 mph is hard and short, and he throws it all hitters. At one point he shelved his slider, but he brought it back with better results command-wise, and it’s more of a gyro-type pitch with more depth than the cutter. He has a changeup but doesn’t throw it as much. Burkhalter was able to show that the improvements he made control-wise in college have stuck, which was even more impressive considering it was his first year back from elbow surgery. The gloves should come off more now, and while he may still end up back in a bullpen one day, the Braves are excited to see what he can do taking the ball in a rotation.

He finally got noticed when he led the Atlantic Sun Conference with 108 strikeouts in 90 innings in 2022, and the White Sox gave him $75,000 as a 13th-round senior sign. One of the most polished pitchers in the system, he paced Chicago farmhands with a 3.9 K/BB ratio last season and would have led the Double-A Southern League in ERA (2.44) if he hadn't fallen a few innings shy of qualifying. Adams had very good feel for spin, producing a plus low-80s curveball with downer break and a solid if less consistent mid-80s slider with two-plane break at its best. He uses his breaking ball as much as he employs his fringy two- and four-seam fastballs, both of which sit at 90-93 mph and top out at 94. He improved his upper-80s changeup, finding more success with improved depth rather than the mild fade he had in the past, though it's still a bit firm. A crafty right-hander, Adams mixes his pitches well and can work all four quadrants of the strike zone with the different movement profiles of his offerings. He creates deception with a flat approach angle and relentlessly fills the strike zone.

Ritchie, taken in the Competitive Balance Round A and signed for just over slot, was sandwiched between Owen Murphy in the first round and Cole Phillips in the second. All three have had elbow problems: Phillips, now with the Mariners, has had two Tommy John surgeries; Murphy had TJ last June and Ritchie is putting his May 2023 surgery in the rearview, having returned to the mound for 49 2/3 innings in 2024. After passing the test of taking the ball regularly and throwing strikes during his return, Ritchie’s velocity and crispness started coming back in 2025. The heater was back to averaging close to 94 mph, according to Synergy, and topping out at 97 mph while missing a decent amount of bats. The sharpness in his low-80s slider, which could get back to being a true out pitch with bite, has also started to reemerge. His changeup was very effective upon his return, and he sells the low-80s offering well with excellent arm speed. Ritchie’s athleticism on the mound helped him repeat his delivery and allowed him to find the strike zone pretty consistently right out of the gate. The gloves can come off a bit in 2025, with the Braves getting their first real look at the Pacific Northwesterner who still has a mid-rotation ceiling.

Ritchie looked like he could have been headed for a breakout in 2023 before undergoing the surgery in late May, and he not only was able to return before the end of 2024, but he shined. He put up a 2.90 ERA with a 27.3/8.3 K%/BB% in 49.2 IP between 3 levels (rookie, A, A+). He looks the part at 6’2”, 185 pounds with a low to mid 90’s fastball, starter’s pitch mix, and potentially above average or better control/command. Both the slider and changeup are legit weapons, giving him the ability to get both lefties and righties out, and the fastball certainly has the ability to tick up into the mid 90’s considering it was closer to the mid 90’s before the injury. With a normal off-season, there is a chance he could look even stronger across the board in 2025, making him a very reasonably priced breakout option.

Davalillo had a more humbling entry into pro ball, signing with the Mets for $30,000 in January 2021, having the deal voided two months later and hooking up with the Rangers for $10,000 in June 2022. He raised his profile significantly by leading the Minors with a 1.88 ERA between two Class A stops last season. Davalillo’s low-80s splitter generated a 58 percent swing-and-miss rate last year and is the lone pitch in his arsenal that grades as better than average. His fastball sits in the low 90s and maxes out at 96 mph, and he’ll ride four-seamers up at the letters and sink two-seamers down at the knees. He has some feel for spinning the ball with his sweeping 78-82 mph slider more effective than his mid-70s curveball, but both could use more power. Though Davalillo doesn’t have the smoothest delivery, he repeats it well. He throws strikes with his entire repertoire, commands his fastball well and sequences his pitches well. He has some of the system’s best feel for pitching, giving him a chance to succeed as a back-of-the-rotation starter.

Injuries kept Prosecky off the mound for most of 2021, and he then served as the Cardinals’ closer in 2022, leading to the Rockies taking him in the sixth round and giving him the chance to start he was hoping to get in college. It looked like a good move after his first full season (2.72 ERA, 10.3 K/9) with Single-A Fresno, but elbow issues limited him to just 48 1/3 IP during the regular season. He did make up for some lost time in the Arizona Fall League. The 6-foot-3 left-hander does have the size and repertoire to potentially start, with a four-pitch mix. At his best, he runs his fastball up to 95-96 mph and can command it well, missing bats with it along the way. He has a slider that has late action with depth, a slower curve that he can use to steal a strike and an improving feel for his changeup as well. Prosecky had thrown just 64 innings in college before topping 100 IP in 2023. The Rockies are hopeful that a now completely healthy Prosecky, who has generally been around the zone when he’s at his best, can hit the reset switch and start moving up the ladder again in 2025.

The Twins got him on Day 3, in the 13th round, part of a Draft class that has produced big leaguer Zebby Matthews as well as fellow pitching prospects Connor Prielipp, Andrew Morris and Cory Lewis. Culpper had a solid, but unspectacular first full season in 2023, then pitched his way from High-A to Double-A with better stuff in 2024, though he missed two months with a forearm strain and a pinched nerve in his right wrist delayed his 2025 debut until the end of May. With a bit of a kitchen sink repertoire, Culpepper can offer many different looks to get hitters out, even if he lacks any purely plus stuff. His fastball averaged around 94 mph last year and topped out at 98 mph, and he can throw his four-seamer up in the zone, then sink a two-seamer to get groundball outs. A key part in developing that part of his arsenal will be to maintain velocity deeper into outings. His low-80s sweeping slider can miss a lot of bats, and he's worked to improve his 89-90 mph cutter; blending the latter pitch with his four-seamer more will help him at the upper levels. Culpepper's walk rate can get elevated against left-handed hitters at times, and being able to land his changeup in the zone against them more should help while giving them a softer look away. There might be more to unlock as Culpepper tweaks some things with his delivery in terms of his lower half load and being more aggressively downhill as he comes off the mound. A few more consistent ticks of velocity could help cement him in a big league rotation.

So even after three years with the Mavericks and then one as Texas Tech's Friday night starter, he was still only 20 when the Twins popped him in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft. He pitched well in his first full season of pro ball but took a bigger step forward in 2024, going from High-A to Triple-A, piling up 133 innings and topping the organization in pitching categories like K/BB (4.16), BAA (.219) and WHIP (1.08). The six-foot Morris has a full arsenal and a firm idea of how to use it. While his fastball averaged only around 94 mph, he could reach up to 97 mph at times. He's working on a sinker he can use against right-handed hitters to help open up the outside part of the plate for his secondary offerings, namely his upper-80s slider and newer cutter, which he throws around 90 mph. Added depth to his slider and strides with that cutter are a big reason why he missed more bats as he moved up the ladder, though he'll need to work to keep those as distinct pitches, and better location of the slider could lead to more chase. He still has a mid-70s curveball he can fold in and a too-firm changeup. Morris has outstanding command, which the Twins put in control-master Zebby Matthews territory. There's hope Morris can add a little more consistent velocity -- he threw a bit harder at the end of 2023 compared to last year, partially because of some lower back issues -- which should allow him to keep missing more bats as he prepares to be yet another mid-round Twins draftee to hit the big league rotation.

He came up big in the postseason, striking out 10 while beating Kansas in the Big 12 Conference tournament, defeating Florida in the NCAA regionals and whiffing 12 in a College World Series victory over Texas A&M as the Sooners finished second in Omaha. Signed for an over-slot $397,500 as a Royals 11th-round pick in 2022 and traded to the Red Sox for John Schreiber in February 2022, he struck out 33 percent of the batters he faced in his first two full pro seasons but also missed time with oblique and forearm strains. Sandlin can make hitters look bad with three different pitches, starting with a fastball that parks at 94-97 mph and peaks at 100, albeit with inconsistent armside run and carry. He switched to more of a sweeping slider in 2024, operating in the mid-80s with good shape, and he can turn it into a tighter upper-80s cutter. He also achieves nice depth on his upper-80s splitter, which can be unhittable at its best. A bit of an enigma, Sandlin has some effort and red flags in his delivery yet repeats it well and fills the strike zone. And despite his quality stuff and control, he got roughed up for a 5.34 ERA and .269/.324/.511 batting line last year. He has the upside to pitch in the front half of a rotation but also comes with reliever risk and will wind up in the bullpen if he can't improve his command and durability.

He has high octane stuff with a mid to upper 90’s fastball, two variations of a slider that miss bats, and a developing changeup/splitter. He pitched in mostly short outings in 2024, and he’s yet to pitch in more than 66.2 IP over the course of a season in pro ball. He’s already 24 years old, so it’s on the old side to be so far from being fully ramped up. It makes me think that Boston views him more as a bullpen weapon on their ascending team. There is upside, and he for sure could work his way into the rotation at some point, but I’m kinda leaning bullpen arm, at least for the first few years of his career. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.23/1.32/48 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 9/3.85/1.26/148 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.652542372881356,0.3389830508474576,0.788135593220339,0.5338983050847458,57.58,75.86206896551724,50.0,,42.25352112676056,3,0.75,50.335506956546574,55.0444274347913,1.0,0–1 yr,-0.8888889000000013,60.666666800000016,70.0,57.282328250437395,20.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,48.91038107269683,sa3020606,playerId

Playing alongside Cam Collier at Chipola that year certainly helped. The Reds took Collier in the first round, then nabbed Huggins in the fourth. It’s been uphill sledding for the right-hander, with Tommy John surgery in June 2023 keeping out until the very end of the '24 season. He started to figure things out in 2025, the third season he spent with Single-A Daytona, though he earned a promotion to High-A Dayton in late July, just ahead of him being sent to the A’s in the Miguel Andujar Trade Deadline deal. A strong and athletic 6-foot-3 right-hander, Huggins has the chance to have a solid three-pitch mix. He’s always had a power arm and his fastball now averages better than 94 mph, touching 97. He backs up the heater with a hard slider he throws in the 86-91 mph range, and has decent feel for an 87-91 mph changeup, producing a 33 percent miss rate combined with Daytona in 2025. While command was an issue for Huggins at Chipola and at the outset of his Reds career, he’s been throwing more consistent strikes with the surgery fully behind him. How much he can develop his secondaries will likely determine what his ultimate role is.

His mid-90s fastball and success as a reliever got him drafted in the third round that July, but he barely pitched in pro ball before last year because of a cyst on his back that required three operations. Finally healthy in 2024, he posted silly numbers (1.16 ERA, .136 average-against, 41 percent K rate) in 31 appearances between three stops, mostly at Double-A. When he dominated in 2024, Reyzelman showcased two plus pitches in a 94-97 mph fastball that touched 99 with more ride than armside run and a tight low-80s slider with significant horizontal break that worked against both lefties and righties. His changeup showed similar velocity and big fade in the opposite direction, though it lacked the consistency of his other offerings. But his arsenal has backed up this year, with his fastball losing 2 mph, as well as life, his sweeper often missing the zone by a wide margin and his changeup becoming unreliable. After throwing 94 percent fastballs at LSU, Reyzelman has changed his approach and cleaned up his mechanics in pro ball. He works out of the stretch, creating a flat approach angle with a low three-quarters arm slot. If he can recapture his 2024 stuff and do a better job of keeping his delivery in sync and providing more strikes, he could join New York's bullpen in the near future.

Cincinnati brought him along slowly, not promoting him to full-season ball until 2024, and he has fared well at two Class A levels in the past two years. The Dodgers acquired him as part of a three-team trade this July that sent catcher Hunter Feduccia to the Rays. Serwinowski keeps adding velocity as he packs more strength onto his 6-foot-5 frame, and he's now sitting at 93-96 mph and touching 101 with plenty of spin and carry on his fastball. He backs up his heater with a low-80s slider with high spin rates and sweeping action. He's developing an upper-80s changeup with fade that shows the potential to become an average pitch. As if his fastball/slider combination wasn't tough enough to deal with, Serwinowski also provides plenty of deception with an extremely short arm action and natural extension in his delivery. His control and command are works in progress but are showing improvement. He has No. 3 starter upside and Los Angeles can afford to be patient with his development.

After taking him in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft, the Phillies decided to develop the right-hander as a starter and after a decent start to his first full season, he faded early on and eventually needed Tommy John surgery that August. He missed all of 2024 as a result but now has a clean bill of health. Scouts have long thought McFarlane could have a chance to start because of his size, elite arm strength and legitimate three-pitch mix. It starts with his fastball that touches triple digits and a move to a two-seamer has worked with his lower arm slot and allowed him to get groundball outs in 2023. He can miss bats with his upper-80s slider, a breaking ball that flashes plus, and his split-changeup was improving before he got shut down with the elbow injury. The biggest thing McFarlane needs to work on, and the reason why he hasn’t stuck in a rotation to date, is his command of all of his offerings after walking 6.8 per nine in 2023. He reportedly added 10-15 pounds of muscle over the course of his TJ rehab and the Phillies think he might be a bit under the radar after the layoff, even if he does eventually land in the back end of a bullpen.

His combination and projectability earned him an over-slot $1,497,500 bonus as a third-rounder. He continues to intrigue with his upside while battling inconsistency, logging a 4.71 ERA with so-so underlying numbers in his first two-plus pro seasons. Milbrandt has a high-spin, four-seam fastball that sits at 92-95 and touches 99 with carry and armside run, though it gets hit when he doesn't command it up in the strike zone. He has struggled to develop a reliable breaking ball, with his low-80s curveball operating as a plus pitch at its best but sometimes featuring so much depth that it makes it easy for hitters to lay off. He reintroduced his mediocre slider with similar velocity, but it blended too much with his curve and he'll try to refine a sweepier version in 2025. Milbrandt's upper-80s changeup has some fade and sink, but it's too firm and regressed last year to the point where he could barely throw it for strikes. Despite his athleticism and clean delivery, he walked 13 percent of the batters he faced in 2024. He maintains his velocity throughout his starts, but added strength could help him repeat his mechanics better while also adding more power to his stuff.

That led to him beating Marco Gonzales as the highest pick in school history, going No. 10 overall to the Rockies. Hughes reached Double-A in his first full season in 2023, but got shut down in July and needed Tommy John surgery. He returned in time to make six starts in the Arizona Fall League in 2024. Hughes was able to use his 17 1/3 innings in the AFL to shake some of the rust off and the good news is that his stuff looked pretty much back to where it was pre-injury. His fastball averaged 93 mph and touched 96, thrown with good sink to frequently get ground-ball contact. His cutter-like slider was regularly in the mid 80s, a hard breaker that flashed plus in the past, and he has some feel to spin a slower 80-82 mph curve, though it’s behind the harder breaking ball. HIs upper-80s changeup is starting to improve as well. Throw out Hughes’ surface numbers in the AFL given they came from his first post-surgery innings. He generally was around the zone previously, though his up-tempo delivery could get out of sync and cause timing issues, which in turn would lead to control problems. His ceiling might be somewhat limited, but once he really puts TJ behind him, he could be a big league back-end starter soon.

Lesko was coming off Tommy John surgery when he made his pro debut in 2023, so some of the extreme control problems were excused, but it actually got worse in 2024, so it’s getting harder and harder to blame rust. He put up a 6.96 ERA with a 19.2/25.6 K%/BB% in 84 IP at High-A. If you thought getting traded to Tampa was going to help, he actually put up an insane 31.1% BB% in 14.1 IP with them, so whatever they tried, clearly didn’t work. Just looking at those numbers, even this ranking seems like wishful thinking, but the stuff is still so good, it really does make you want to stay patient. The fastball sits mid to upper 90’s, the changeup is his best secondary and it’s a nasty pitch that can end up double plus, and the curve is another potentially plus pitch. But he’s clearly very far away from putting it all together. He’s a high upside lotto ticket right now. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 7/4.16/1.34/150 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.0,0.04395604395604396,0.0,0.01098901098901099,1.4,,,,42.6559356136821,1,0.25,33.05835010060362,12.480422535211266,0.45,2–4 yr,1.0666666000000014,37.200000799999984,26.25,10.094126880563378,54.41666600000001,0.49274999999999985,Mixed,9.069857356253513,sa3020677,playerId

The Blue Jays targeted Barriera with the No. 23 overall pick in the ‘22 Draft, signing him to an above-slot bonus of $3,597,500. Barriera had development staffers buzzing in early ‘24, but he suffered an elbow injury early in the season that required a hybrid Tommy John and internal brace procedure. After losing a crucial year of development, Barriera is scheduled to return to game action in May or June. Prior to that injury, Barriera’s stuff was all the way back. He was hitting 97 mph in spring games a year ago, paired with a slider that projects as a legitimate out pitch at the next level. While the surgery was a major setback, Barriera used the time to get his body in better shape, and the Blue Jays believed they were getting the best version they’ve seen of him yet. He made five rehab starts in the Florida Complex League in 2025 before suffering yet another unfortunate injury -- this time a small fractured piece of his forearm -- and that ended his season in July. Barriera will still only be 22 entering 2026, but his prospect status is wearing thin, regardless of how he's looked in various comebacks. Getting healthy and sticking to the mound in games will be paramount next season, especially with the Jays' pitching pipeline getting all the stronger this year.

Signed for a well-over-slot $3 million as a supplemental first-rounder by the Padres, he dominated while advancing to Double-A in his first full pro season before slumping terribly to start 2024. Sent to the Marlins in a July deal for Tanner Scott and Bryan Hoeing, Snelling logged a 6.01 ERA before the trade and a 3.64 mark afterward. Snelling's fastball dropped from working at 92-95 mph in 2023 to sitting at 91-93 and topping out at 95 last year, but he has recaptured that lost velocity in 2025. His heater lacks movement, so he relies on using a flat approach angle to produce carry up in the zone. His best pitch is a low-80s slurve that also lost velocity and effectiveness in the first half of 2024 before playing as a solid pitch afterward. While Snelling's fading changeup can elicit some ugly swings, it's too firm in the mid-80s and he doesn't land it in the strike zone consistently. His football background shows in his aggressive mentality on the mound, though he challenged hitters less often when he was getting roughed up in Double-A last season. His ceiling doesn't look nearly as high as it did the year before, but the ingredients are still there for at least a No. 4 starter.

He put up a 5.54 ERA with a 22.6/8.8 K%/BB% in 115.1 IP at mostly Double-A. And he doesn’t have the type of stuff to overlook the poor numbers with a pretty average at best 4 pitch mix. The fastball and sinker sit 93 MPH, the slider is solid and the changeup is still developing. He’s a bull on the mound at an athletic 6’3”, 210 pounds, and this is 2nd straight year of staying healthy and racking up innings. He was also heating up in the 2nd half with a 3.64 ERA and 28.3/7.7 K%/BB% in his final 54.1 IP, showing that great 2023 was not a complete mirage. If you combine both seasons, he has a 3.58 ERA with a 233/79 K/BB in 219 IP, and you have to take into account that he was a 20 year old in the upper minors all season this year. It’s a workhorse #4 type profile right now, but coming into his age 21 year old season, I think there is upside in here for more with continued refinement. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.53/1.38/40 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 8/4.16/1.32/152 in 165 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.940677966101695,0.7542372881355932,0.8983050847457628,0.923728813559322,87.66,89.28571428571429,100.0,,34.80885311871227,3,0.75,64.75492661853474,79.64322431648716,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.716666700000001,94.60000040000001,70.0,86.29596735494616,20.0,0.6799999999999999,SP,68.75318538972577,sa3020707,playerId

He’s moved up exactly one level per season since with stops at Single-A Palm Beach (2023), High-A Peoria (2024) and Double-A Springfield and a stint in the Arizona Fall League mixed in last year. His results seemed to hit a wall in the Midwest League, but the former Torero has bounced back nicely in his age-23 season. Throwing from a low three-quarters slot, the 6-foot-3 southpaw has added some velocity with Springfield and now is in the 91-95 mph range with enough ride to get decent whiffs. His slider has long been his best pitch with good depth to play off that heater and generate misses, and he’s added a cutter to keep righties off-balance. His mid-80s changeup has shown improved movement in recent years but still doesn’t miss many bats, making another option necessary against opposite-side bats. He can also flip in a 79-81 mph curveball to steal strikes. Even with the added velocity, Mautz’s control has steadily improved throughout his time in pro ball, and he has enough pitches in his arsenal to keep getting starting looks. The Cardinals tried him out in the bullpen in the AFL (in part because he already had plenty of innings from the summer), and he still might profile best there if splits against righties become more of an issue at higher levels. His 2025 trajectory has still reinforced his place in St. Louis’ pitching pipeline.

He followed future big leaguers Drey Jameson, Kyle Nicolas and Chayce McDermott to give Ball State its fourth top-five-round pitcher in five Drafts when the White Sox popped him in the fifth round that July. One of the most consistent starters in the system, he logged a 4.02 ERA with a 136/41 K/BB ratio in 132 innings between High-A and Double-A last year. After his fastball operated around 90 mph in college, Schweitzer has gotten stronger and now sits at 91-93 with a high of 96, and it plays up thanks to high spin rates that create carry. His slider also has gotten hotter, averaging 84 mph last year compared to 79 mph in 2022, and flashes as a solid offering with two-plane depth at times. He keeps hitters off balance by mixing in an upper-70s curveball and a too-firm changeup in the mid-80s with more downhill plane than life. Schweitzer walks a fine line by throwing consistent strikes without catching too much of the plate with his decidedly average stuff. He mixes his offerings and locations well, giving him the chance to crack the back of a big league rotation. He's not very physical but has proven very durable and efficient in three years as a college and pro starter.

After signing for full slot at $3,182,200, the southpaw pitched two months at High-A Peoria before undergoing surgery to remove loose bodies in his left elbow. He made seven Arizona Fall League appearances to make up for some of the lost time. He returned to the Midwest League to begin 2024, was promoted to Double-A Springfield in early June and struck out 20 in 14 2/3 innings before hitting the injured list again with elbow inflammation. He was considered healthy to begin spring but opened the season on the IL and underwent Tommy John surgery that will keep him out until the middle of 2026. The 6-foot-3 left-hander can wow evaluators with sidearm mechanics that make virtually his entire arsenal tough to touch. He regained some velocity in 2024, back to 90-93 mph with his fastball. The pitch is tough to read with such a flat approach angle, leading to a higher whiff rate than many faster heaters. His upper-70s sweeper breaks hard gloveside, and lefties particularly can do little but wave at it. His 79-82 mph changeup can be a weapon against righties too as a cambio with good separation and almost equal horizontal break to the slider except going the other way. The former Beaver has also incorporated a mid-80s cutter for a sharper bridge pitch. The break on his stuff in all directions can make it difficult to land in the zone at times, but it can still work with the amount of goofy swings Hjerpe elicits. Health has been a consistent issue for Hjerpe as a pro, and he’ll be 25 when he returns to the professional mound, at which time the calls for him to move to the bullpen might be louder than ever.

Standing at 6-foot-6, the southpaw touched 97 mph in that first full season but often sat more in the 91-94 mph range but with a tailing two-seamer. He couldn’t hold that velocity as 2023 wore on in a sign that the elbow was an issue but is back to that range in 2025. His mid-80s changeup works as his best pitch, a true fader with decent separation and good armside movement. The sinker and changeup helped drive impressive groundball rates at every stop. Another mid-80s option in his slider projects more like an average pitch. Bennett didn’t walk more than two batters in any of his 15 appearances in 2023, but the control has been closer to average in his return. His combination of size and stuff still offers plenty of intrigue. He'll have a chance to impress his new organization after being dealt to the Red Sox for fellow prospect Luis Perales.

He tried to rehab the injury but wound up having Tommy John surgery in January 2022, missed his junior season at Arkansas and signed for an over-slot $1.5 million with the White Sox as a second-rounder. Chicago moved him to the bullpen by mid-2024 and chose not to protect him on its 40-man roster this November, setting the stage for the Guardians to grab him in the Rule 5 Draft. Pallette works at 94-96 mph and touches 98 with high spin rates on his fastball. His mid-80s slider has surpassed his low-80s downer curveball as his best secondary offering, though both can be plus pitches at their best. He can fool hitters with the depth on his mid-80s changeup, though it has more plane than life and can get pounded if he doesn't locate it well. Because he's not especially tall and has an upright delivery, Pallette creates more downhill plane than extension, so he needs to command his fastball up in the zone to be effective. He's throwing more strikes as a reliever than he did as a starter, and he looks like a potential setup man. Per Rule 5 guidelines, he'll have to stick on Cleveland's big league roster throughout the 2026 season or else be placed on waivers and offered back to the White Sox for half his $100,000 draft price.

He barely pitched as freshman at Texas A&M before spending a year at San Jacinto (Texas) JC and then strained his rotator cuff at Texas Tech in 2021. After avoiding surgery and spurning the Twins as an 11th-rounder that summer, he won Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Year accolades and turned pro as a Cubs fifth-rounder in 2022. He won their Minor League Pitcher of the Year award in 2024, but he missed the first two months of this season with a lat strain before blowing out his elbow in August, resulting in Tommy John surgery that will cost him all of 2026. Birdsell gets a lot of swings and misses in and out of the strike zone with his fastball, which sits at 94-96 mph and tops out at 98 with a nice mix of carry, armside run and command. His mid-80s slider features two-plane depth and grades as a plus pitch at its best. His upper-70s curveball has similar shape and is a more effective change of pace than his actual upper-80s changeup with mild fade that he barely uses. Hitters don't see the ball well against Birdsell, who has an upright delivery with one of the shortest arm actions you'll see and precious little extension. He repeats his mechanics well, pounds the strike zone and locates his fastball with precision. His medical history may have hurt his stock in the 2022 Draft, but he has been healthy for the last three years and looks like an innings-eating No. 4 starter.

Like Mazur, he has plus control of a 95 MPH fastball that doesn’t have a great movement profile, although Birdsell’s fastball missed considerably more bats at Triple-A than Mazur’s did. And like Mazur he has an above average slider as his best secondary to go along with a starter’s pitch mix. It all resulted in a 3.91 ERA with a 23.5/5.4 K%/BB% in 135.2 IP split between Double-A and Triple-A. Like Mazur, I’m leaning towards more of a #4 starter as a reasonable upside projection for Birdsell.

It's been difficult to get him on the mound at all since signing, having internal brace surgery in 2023 after two starts and totaling just 6 2/3 IP that season. The organization is cautiously optimistic that perhaps he's slowly turning a corner after a 2024 season that saw all of his stuff pop, albeit for just 23 1/3 innings. Yes, it was a very small sample size, but the 2024 season was the first that Prielipp showed off the first-round caliber stuff that had him on Draft radars in the first place. His fastball averaged a tick over 94 mph in shorter stints, touching 97 mph, and he was up to 94 mph in bullpen sessions in early camp this year while not going full-tilt. His upper-80s slider missed bats at a 56 percent clip, but it may have been his 85-86 mph changeup that was his best secondary, thrown with a ton of deception and generating a 62 percent miss rate. Prielipp showed last year that he can land all three of his pitches in the strike zone, and all three get swings-and-misses. The Twins will lean into the cautious part of cautious optimism because of the injury history and manage his workload. He's still seen as a starter long-term, though some feel he could impact the big league staff at some point this year in a relief role.

He put up a 2.70 ERA with a 45.1/7.7 K%/BB% in 23.1 IP at mostly High-A. The fastball sits mid 90’s and is a bat missing, which he pairs with a plus to double plus slider.

After missing much of his junior season with forearm stiffness, he was the Razorbacks' top starter in 2022 and joined the Cubs as a ninth-rounder. He hasn't let a well-below-average fastball stop him from reaching Triple-A Iowa midway through his second full pro season and functioning as the I-Cubs' most effective starter in 2025. Noland's two- and four-seam fastballs sit at 90 mph and rarely reach 92, so he just doesn't throw them very often. His order of preference for his six-pitch repertoire is as follows: upper-80s cutter, low-80s slider, upper-70s curveball, mid-80s changeup, two-seamer, four-seamer. His slider is his lone offering that grades as better than average, and his curveball is his only other pitch that even reaches that standard. Nevertheless, Noland makes his kitchen-sink approach work. He consistently locates all of his pitches -- save his changeup -- where he wants them, though his need to work around the plate rather than challenge hitters had led to just average walk rates in Triple-A. It's unclear whether he has enough stuff to succeed in the Majors but he's on the verge of getting a chance to find out.

The Angels took a low-risk flyer on the left-hander in the 17th round of the 2022 Draft, and he kept striking guys out and giving them free passes during his pro debut with High-A Tri-City in 2023. A sprained elbow kept him off the mound for all but 15 innings during the regular season, but he opened a lot of eyes with his work over five Arizona Fall League outings. It was a small sample size spanning just 12 innings, but Natera’s combination of size, stuff and better feel for the zone made people sit up and take notice. His fastball averaged around 94-95 mph and touched 98, and it plays up because of its life that allows it to get a lot of swings and misses. His 82-85 mph slider has good sweep to it, giving him another bat-missing offering. He has a changeup, but he doesn’t throw it very often. While Natera is already 25, he has very low mileage on his arm between starting late, the pandemic and the missed time in 2024. In his brief mound time last year, he was finding the strike zone with more consistency, raising the bar a little bit more. Left-handers who are 6-foot-4 and have two out pitches tend to make it to the big leagues, so everyone is intrigued to see how Natera follows up his AFL breakout.

He made only four starts in his first full season because of shoulder problems but thankfully avoided the injured list entirely in his age-21 campaign. He was a California League end-of-season All-Star after posting a 3.00 ERA and a 1.18 WHIP with 89 strikeouts in 72 innings for Single-A Lake Elsinore and finished out the year with seven starts in High-A Fort Wayne. Throwing from the lower range of a three-quarters delivery, the sturdy 6-foot-1 right-hander ran his fastball up to 97 mph last season and generally sat 92-95. There was some tailing action on the pitch as he tended to land it up and armside. His 79-82 mph slider played well nicely off the heat, dropping just as it reached the plate to fool batters to his gloveside. The slider had a 44 percent whiff rate on its own, though it hasn't played nearly to that standard in 2025. An 85-87 mph changeup didn’t get much chase outside of the zone, and lefties handled Lowe much better than their right-handed counterparts as a result. Lowe throws enough strikes to keep him in Minor League rotations for now, but there isn’t a ton of projection left in his frame. The fastball-slider combination should work in shorter stints if he ever needs to head to the bullpen, and after a healthy 2024, there is certainly an arrow pointed up next to his name.

CC to Connecticut in four years of college, earning All-America honors in his final season in 2022 when he ranked second in NCAA Division I with 11 wins and third with a Huskies-record 147 strikeouts in 110 1/3 innings. His performance stood out more than his stuff, so he lasted until Cleveland drafted him in the ninth round. He shook off a so-so 2023 pro debut to lead the Minors with 14 victories and a 0.89 WHIP last year while placing second in K/BB ratio (7.6) and walk rate (4 percent) and advancing to Double-A. Relying heavily on deception, Peterson uses his 6-foot-6 frame to create plenty of extension and has the feel to manipulate the ball to produce three solid secondary pitches. His low-80s slider and upper-70s curveball both feature downward action, as does his fading mid-80s changeup, and all three elicit a lot of chases. He has added strength since turning pro and his fastball has gained a couple of ticks velocity to average 92 mph and top out at 95, and it's effective when he locates it up in the zone. Repeating his easy three-quarters delivery with precision, Peterson has the best control and command in the system. He'll still have to prove he can keep Triple-A and big league hitters off his fastball and get them to fish outside the zone for his secondary pitches, which he can fall in low with a bit too much at times. He comes with a high floor as a likely back-of-the-rotation option, and the Guardians believe they can help him find more velocity and ceiling.

The Dodgers liked him enough as a pitcher to take a 17th-round flier on him, signing him for $125,000. He wowed evaluators inside and outside of the organization when his stuff took a jump in his 2023 pro debut, then regressed physically last year before getting back on track this summer. Martin's fastball is back to sitting in the mid-90s and topping out at 99 mph. While it features carry, it can straighten out at times and get hammered if he doesn't locate it well. His best offering is a mid-80s slider and he also will spin some upper-70s curveballs to give hitters a different look. Just 6 feet tall, Martin is more athletic and electric than physical, and he works with an up-tempo delivery. To remain a starter as he climbs through the Minors, he'll need to refine a mid-80s changeup that he struggles to throw for strikes and also improve his fastball command. If he can't stick in the rotation, he could become a dynamic two-pitch reliever.

When he turned his focus to only pitching, he showed enough potential that the Royals took him in the fourth round of the 2022 Draft, signing him to a $500,000 bonus. The Royals had an innings limit on Zobac in his first full year of pro ball, and he split it between Single-A and High-A. In 2024, they took off the reins and Zobac broke out, posting a 3.64 ERA between High-A and Double-A across 126 innings en route to Royals’ Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors. Zobac’s stuff plays up because of his plus command. He knows where to put the ball and goes right at hitters, evidenced by his 5.6% walk rate in 2024. His strikeout rate between the two levels was 23.8%, and he doesn’t blow hitters away, but his pitchability and command has helped him. Zobac’s fastball is a high-spin 92-94 mph heater with good carry that touched 97 at Double-A. His mid-to-upper 80s slider is a plus pitch that misses bats with good shape and location to the glove side, and he flashed a fringe-average mid-80s changeup that he needs to continue to refine. He changed the grip on that pitch a few times in ‘24 but is still tinkering to find something he’s most comfortable with, and he’ll need it against lefties at the higher levels. Better accustomed to a starter’s workload in 2024, Zobac held up throughout a career-high year in terms of innings. He’s athletic with a repeatable and simple delivery that helps him command the ball so well, and he gets high marks for his intelligence on the mound and in-game prep. From becoming a full-time pitcher in 2022 to reaching Double-A by his second full pro season, Zobac has moved quicker than maybe even the Royals originally thought he would. His fastball-slider combo would fit well in a Major League bullpen, but the development of a third pitch will be key to his upside as a starter.

He certainly looks the part at an athletic 6’3”, 185 pounds. His stuff is good with a low to mid 90’s fastball that has a great movement profile and is a bat missing weapon, to go along with an above average slider and solid changeup. And he has plus control over the entire arsenal. The final box is that he has upper minors production too with a 3.25 ERA and 28.6/6.2 K%/BB% in 55.1 IP at Double-A. He wasn’t quite as good at High-A with a 3.95 ERA and 20.0/5.2 K%/BB% in 70.2 IP, so I would temper expectations a bit, but there is a lot to like here. He definitely falls into that pitching prospect bucket that I like to take shots in, but Zobac is still probably more for medium to deeper leagues than shallower ones right now. – 2025 Projection: 1/4.30/1.32/35 in 40 IP Prime Projection: 10/4.05/1.25/154 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.22516556291390732,0.2980132450331126,0.7814569536423841,0.5165562913907285,41.76,62.96296296296296,42.85714285714286,70.45454545454545,46.076458752515094,4,1.0,53.149968836588556,45.74648909280599,1.0,1–2 yr,1.4638887999999994,32.43333440000001,85.0,41.5569468878418,29.638887999999994,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,37.74145977952881,sa3020875,playerId

The southpaw experienced elbow issues in what would have been his first pro season and underwent Tommy John surgery. He didn’t officially debut until April 2023 and then made only 11 abbreviated starts for Single-A Lake Elsinore that summer due to blister and shoulder issues. That made 2024 his first truly full Minor League campaign and he amassed 110 2/3 innings at High-A Fort Wayne, posting a 4.64 ERA with 114 strikeouts and 66 walks. The important bit was that Haynes stayed on the mound throughout ’24, never going on the IL. His four-seam fastball lost a little bit of velocity in the process, sitting 90-92 mph and touching 94. (It's back up to 91-94, touching 96 in 2025.) It has some armside run to it, but it isn’t a whiff-heavy pitch. Those swings-and-misses came primarily from his low-80s gyro slider -- a straight dropper that can often look like a curveball -- and 81-84 mph changeup. The latter posted a 47 percent whiff rate but was gettable if he didn’t bury it below the zone. Righties could handle that and also jumped all over Haynes’ fastball, leading to notable splits issues. Haynes battled control issues, seemed to iron them out in the middle of the season and then lost the zone again late as his workload piled up. Getting the command to return is all part of the process in TJ recovery, so that will be all the more under the microscope in 2025. Haynes was left unprotected and unpicked in the Rule 5 Draft after 2024, but another year of health and experience could make him a 40-man candidate after this season.

Twelfth-round pick Tyrone Taylor has spent time in the big leagues the past two years, and while Tyler Gough is rehabbing from Tommy John surgery, he’s still a well-regarded pitching prospect who went in Round 9. Perez was a college senior taken in the 11th round who didn’t really register on the prospect radar until this season, when an uptick in velocity has led to better results and enabled him to pitch his way from High-A Everett to Double-A Arkansas. An undersized right-hander at 5-foot-10, Perez is all about strikes and spin. His fastball has ticked up to averaging around 93 mph. It’s not a difference-maker, but his ability to hold and command his velocity in longer starts has helped him improve. He has two different sliders he throws more than the heater, and both are effective -- a shorter gyro-like breaker at around 87 mph and a low-80s sweeper. Helping all of his stuff play up is his ability to fill up the strike zone with all of his offerings. His walk rates continue to be very low, even as he climbs the ladder. His ceiling might be limited because of the lack of a true out pitch or above-average heat, but he could pitch his way into a No. 5 starter/swingman role in the big leagues.

After he made a strong pro debut the following year, the Cubs dealt him and outfield prospect Zyhir Hope to Los Angeles for Michael Busch and Yency Almonte in January 2024. Ferris earned Dodgers organization Pitcher of the Year honors after placing third in the Minors among pitchers age 20 or younger with 145 strikeouts in 126 2/3 innings and finishing the season with a 2.54 ERA in seven Double-A starts. Ferris' fastball sits at 92-95 mph and touches 97, and his combination of extension, flat approach angle and carry make it difficult to barrel. Los Angeles had him scrap a low-80s sweeper that Chicago had helped him develop in favor of a harder, tighter mid-80s slider that he throws more easily for strikes and looks like a plus offering. His upper-70s downer curveball has similar upside, though it wasn't as effective in 2024 as he spent more time focusing on his new slider. Ferris' mid-80s changeup shows flashes of becoming a solid offering but could use more consistent fade and sink, and upgrading it will be a point of emphasis in 2025. He operates with a somewhat complicated delivery that can get out of sync, but he's doing a better job of repeating it and throwing strikes as he gets stronger. He has drawn physical comparisons to Blake Snell and has better stuff and mechanics at the same stage of their careers.

He put a 3.39 ERA with a 29.2/10.5 K%/BB% in 98.1 IP at High-A and a 2.54 ERA with a 21.3/11.5 K%/BB% in 28.1 IP at Double-A. The stuff is good, but it’s not really standout with a low to mid 90’s fastball, two good breaking balls, and a lesser used, but good change. He gets a lot of “looks the part” extra hype as a 6’4”, 195 pound lefty with an athletic delivery, but as is, it might be a back end profile. The reason why I was so quick to jump on him, and why he gets lots of love, is because we try to project who a player could be in the prospect world, and at his young age with his projectable frame, you can definitely dream on a mid rotation starter or better with an extra tick on the fastball and continued refinement. Again, I like him a lot, but I would be hesitant to put too high a value on him right now. I’m staying a little cautious here.

After signing for $2.8 million as the 26th overall pick, Schultz worked just 27 innings in his 2023 pro debut while dealing with a flexor strain and a shoulder impingement. He stayed healthy in 2024 and earned Southern League Pitcher of the Year accolades by posting a 1.48 ERA and a 73/17 K/BB ratio in 61 innings following a promotion to Double-A in late May, though he hasn't been nearly as dominant this season. With his 6-foot-10 frame and low three-quarters arm slot, Schultz creates exceptional horizontal movement on a wipeout slider that continues to gain velocity -- now sitting in the low 80s and reaching 88 mph. He has boosted his fastball from 89-92 mph in high school to 93-97 with a peak of 99 mph as a pro. He blows four-seamers by hitters up in the strike zone but doesn't miss many bats when he tries to sink heavy two-seamers, generating a lot of ground-ball contact instead. Schultz has done a nice job honing an upper-80s changeup that can get a bit firm but is an effective offering that fades in an opposite direction from his slider. He has advanced body control for a pitcher who is so large and so young, and his control and command both grade as better than average. His frame, arm angle and slider prompt inevitable comparisons to Randy Johnson, but Schultz is a much more polished pitcher at the same stage of development.

Even the Baby Johnson nickname might not fit, as Randy Johnson had an insane 318 walks in 400.1 minor league IP before getting the call to the bigs. Schultz is 6’9”, 220 pounds with an almost sidearm lefty delivery that he uses to fire a mid to upper 90’s fastball and double plus slider (he also mixes in a cutter and a change). He sliced through the minors with absolutely no problem, putting up a 2.24 ERA with a 32.1/6.7% K%/BB% in 88.1 IP at mostly Double-A. Having that level of control as a 20/21 year old at that size with that kind of stuff is really mind blowing. He’s not a finished product as he’s yet to eclipse 4 IP in any outing of his career and he needs to continue to work on a good third/fourth pitch, but the combination of floor/upside is simply off the charts. Other than Roki Sasaki (who really shouldn’t be considered a prospect), and Painter now that he’s healthy, there is no other pitching prospect I would take over Schultz. – 2025 Projection: 3/3.71/1.24/82 in 75 IP Prime Projection: 15/3.05/1.01/230 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.39830508474576276,0.288135593220339,0.17796610169491522,0.11864406779661017,27.21,96.55172413793103,85.71428571428572,,97.98792756539235,3,0.75,86.90894862073046,48.10463201725566,1.0,0–1 yr,-3.3444445000000016,90.13333400000002,70.0,42.9168897051767,20.0,0.6199999999999999,Mixed,48.339267167329524,sa3020949,playerId

His 29.1 K-BB% led the Florida State League among 112 pitchers with at least 40 frames, while his 34.5 strikeout percentage ranked second and his 2.47 FIP third. Gastelum fanned three of his four batters faced (including the final one) in Palm Beach’s FSL championship clincher on Sept. 18, and he’s continued his momentum in the Mexican Winter League. The 6-foot-2 right-hander proved so dominant because of his special changeup. The 81-84 mph cambio averaged -1.6 inches of induced vertical break and 15.5 inches of armside movement, giving it two planes with which to menace hitters. Gastelum threw 317 changeups tracked by Statcast; 161 of them (50.8 percent) ended up as called strikes or whiffs. No one else in the FSL had a CSW rate higher than 41.1 percent (min. 50 changeups), and no one in the Majors had one higher than 41.0 (Angel Chivili) over the same minimum. Gastelum threw his change 47.9 percent of the time because it was so effective. The other side of the coin: the righty’s fastball is much less remarkable as a 91-93 mph offering with ordinary movement, and his mid-80s slider is the closest pitch to flashing above-average. Devin Williams comps would be misguided because at least the Yankees reliever has more fastball velo and usage, but that type of change-heavy profile out of the bullpen gives the righty a profile on which to dream. The Cards prospect will be 23 for the majority of the 2025 season, so it’ll be time for St. Louis to see just how quickly he can ride that changeup toward The Show.

He had been hitting and pitching for his high school team in New York’s Westchester County, hardly a baseball hotbed, and focused exclusively on pitching during his junior year. He didn’t turn 18 until two months after the Rays picked him and signed him for $597,500. He was extremely raw, and it looked that way during his professional debut in 2023. But Gill Hill may have improved as much as any player in the organization last year, posting a 3.15 ERA in 108 2/3 innings over 22 outings for Single-A Charleston in his first full season. Last spring, Gill Hill put on more muscle on his 6-foot-2 frame and shifted his arm slot up to an upper three-quarters delivery, which led to improved velocity and more depth on his offspeed stuff. His primary pitch is a fastball in the 93-95 mph range, touching 96-97, although his velocity faded a bit toward the end of his first full season. He complements that with a low-80s slider, a cutter in the mid-to-upper 80s and the occasional changeup that helped him limit lefties to a .650 OPS last year. Especially for such a young player -- he turned 20 last September -- Gill Hill displayed impressive control, walking only 2.2 batters per nine innings. Arm slot consistency played a part in that, but he has also shown impressive maturity and intent despite his inexperience. The right-hander doesn’t have a true plus pitch at this point, but the depth of his arsenal and his feel for using it should keep him on a faster-than-anticipated track toward the Majors.

His nasty stuff has plus potential across the board with excellent movement on all of his pitches. The mid 90’s fastball is a bat missing weapon, he can throw the plus breaking ball both in and out of the zone, and the changeup flashes plus as well. And while he’s not a control artist, he has solid command over all of his pitches, especially relative to his age. It resulted in a 3.15 ERA with a 24.2/6.2 K%/BB% in 108.2 IP at Single-A. If he keeps getting stronger, there could be another tick or two of velocity in here at peak, and his delivery is so easy he certainly has the potential to end up with plus command at peak too. He’s young and needs to refine his game all around, but there is considerable upside in here, and the floor is about as high as it gets for a 19 year old pitcher in A ball. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 12/3.69/1.18/167 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.6224489795918368,0.05102040816326531,0.9489795918367347,0.4489795918367347,50.73,34.61538461538461,,,62.97786720321932,2,0.5,43.48614120621163,48.194649422174066,1.0,2–4 yr,-0.9694445000000016,61.63333400000002,55.0,51.60489492665222,25.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,42.798869516993506,sa3020972,playerId

They slow-rolled him, with Graves not making his pro debut until 2023 in the Florida Complex League, and that didn’t go well. But a move to full-season ball in 2024 provided the first glimpse of what the future might look like, with a 31.8 percent strikeout rate over 84 innings with Clearwater as a 20-year old. There are few players in the Phillies system who made more strides in one year than Graves did in 2024. The 6-foot-6 southpaw can attack hitters with as many as five pitches. He’ll throw both a four-seamer up in the zone and a two-seamer with sink in the 90-95 mph range, getting a lot of groundballs with the latter. He’s already added some strength, with room for more, so it’s easy to dream on him living more in the 93-95 mph range and holding it, making the fastball more playable. Graves can really spin a breaking ball, registering spin rates north of 3,000 rpm with his slider. He has a separate cutter, though the two pitches run into each other, both missing a ton of bats in the low-80s. His changeup took a nice step forward, killing spin with it. Graves also improved dramatically in finding the strike zone, lowering his walk rate to 3.9 per nine in 2024. Continued work on his command, especially the secondary stuff, along with expected velocity gains, could allow him to keep evolving into a big league starter.

Then there are the under-the-radar types like Bohorquez, who signed out of Venezuela for just $10,000 in January 2023 at the ripe old age of 18. He didn’t jump off the page during his Dominican Summer League debut after signing, but opened a lot of eyes by pitching his way from the Florida Complex League to full-season Fort Myers during his U.S. debut in 2024. After a ho-hum start to 2025, something seemed to click in the second half, with the right-hander posting a 2.47 ERA and .185 batting average against from July 1 through the end of the season, a span that included a solid stretch of six outings up in High-A to close out the year. Bohorquez can miss bats with all four of his pitches, as evidenced by his 27.2 percent strikeout rate in 2025, and he racked up a better K rate up a level in Cedar Rapids. His fastball now averages close to 95 mph and is up to 98 as a starter with good carry. His 88-90 mph slider could be a true out pitch in time and he continues to register high spin rates with his low-80s curve that features good depth. His changeup remains a work in progress, but it also has shown depth when he’s executing the pitch correctly. Command and control have been issues for the 6-foot-1 since he joined the Twins organization, but in that July-September stretch, he walked just 2.47 per nine. That’s still a relatively small sample size and there’s still high variance here, but there’s more of an up arrow next to his name as he approaches his age 21 season in 2026.

But he’s made a big impression through two seasons, first on both the Dominican and Arizona complex circuits in ’23 and then between Single-A and High-A last year. Chalas posted a 4.09 ERA with 72 strikeouts and 26 walks in 50 2/3 innings (all in relief) between Visalia and Hillsboro in his age-20 campaign. His 32.1 percent strikeout rate was third-highest among 40 D-backs Minor Leaguers with at least 50 frames in 2024. Standing 6-foot-3, the right-hander drops and drives well from atop the bump, generating plus-plus velocity that regularly touches the upper 90s. Low-level hitters just can’t handle that level of velocity, and right-handers struggled with Chalas’ heater coming up and in. He plays off it with a mid-80s slider that flashed plus with sharp gloveside dive out of a lowish arm slot. Chalas didn’t have a changeup in ’24, and lefties punished him appropriately with a .463 slugging percentage, compared to .291 for righties. The D-backs challenged him to find a third pitch, and it looks like a sinker-splitter hybrid (i.e., the splinker) may win out after offseason work. That would be a good fit for such a hard thrower with that release point, but picking up such a unique pitch isn’t as easy as Paul Skenes or Jhoan Duran make it look. Still, Chalas’ continued breakout has many across the industry intrigued, including Arizona, which won’t rule out trying Chalas as a starter the more he proves himself stateside. His control was solid for a reliever, especially late in the 2024 season, and it’s worth trying out Chalas’ stuff in a longer role before he knocks on the door of the desert.

He pitched in the Dominican Summer League in his each of his first two seasons, first primarily as a reliever and then as a true starter. He dominated the Florida Complex League this summer in his first stateside campaign, leading the circuit with a 30.8 percent strikeout rate (min. 40 IP) and finished with a 1.99 ERA over 45 1/3 frames. The Tigers sent him to Single-A Lakeland in August. The 6-foot right-hander has built up nice velocity early in his career, touching 98.5 mph in his full-season debut and typically sitting in the mid-90s all season long. The movement profile and below-average extension cap its stuff models. Salcedo’s upper-80s slider is where his mix gets truly special. The pitch comes with cutter-like velocity and gloveside movement but shows impressive drop and spin that fools batters routinely. There’s some promise in a mid-80s splitter too, but his command of it can be all over the place. Salcedo is a ground-ball merchant, routinely posting GB rates above 50 percent at each stop. His control numbers have been solid so far, but he relies on batters biting on the diving slider below the zone. There’s a pretty clear road for Salcedo as a hard-throwing reliever with a special secondary, but given he’s still two full seasons away from Rule 5 eligibility, the Tigers ought to see just how far he can take pitching in longer outings.

He dominated in his U.S. debut in 2024, compiling a 1.99 ERA, .125 opponent average and 68 strikeouts in 63 1/3 innings between Rookie ball and Single-A. Boston surrendered three teenage right-handers (Gilberto Batista, Ovis Portes, Yeferson Vargas) at the Trade Deadline last summer but wouldn't part with Valera. At age 18 last year, Valera operated with a 93-96 mph fastball that peaked at 99, usually working with downhill plane but occasionally showing some interesting carry. He gets better action on his sweeping 82-85 mph slider and can turn it into a tighter cutter that climbs into the upper 80s. He's in the early stages of developing feel for his fading upper-80s changeup, struggling to throw it for strikes or create enough separation from his heater. Working from a simple side-step delivery and a three-quarters arm slot, Valera likes to vary his tempo to throw off hitters' timing. There's still some projection remaining in his 6-foot-3 frame, so he may add more power, and he could blossom into a mid-rotation starter if he can polish his changeup, control and command. The Red Sox love his mound presence, work ethic and ability to translating instruction into improvements.

CC to the Junior College World Series in 2021 and 2022. Named national juco pitcher of the year in '22 after leading that level in victories (14) and strikeouts (160 in 93 1/3 innings), he joined the Rangers as an 11th-rounder. After getting tattooed for a 6.36 ERA in his 2023 pro debut, he established himself as the system's best lefty last year while posting a 2.29 ERA, .196 average-against and 148/31 K/BB ratio while advancing from Single-A to Double-A. He was enjoying another strong year in the upper Minors in 2025 when the Rangers dealt him to the D-backs at the Deadline in the trade for Merrill Kelly. Drake dedicated himself to bettering his strength and conditioning after the 2023 season, dropped 25 pounds off his 6-foot-5 frame and began moving more explosively down the mound. He went from operating with an 88-90 mph fastball at Walters State to dealing at 92-94 and reaching 96 with carry. He also showed better feel for spin, with his low-80s curveball missing plenty of bats and his slightly harder slider flashing as a solid offering as well. His low-80s changeup with fade and sink works well in concert with the shape of his heater. Though Drake had a track record of providing strikes, improved core strength, balance and athleticism helped him upgrade his control even more. His combination of size and a short arm action provides some deception, as does his flat approach angle. If he can continue to get more advanced hitters to chase his curveball and changeup, he could make it as a No. 4 starter.

While the Mariners may have made more noise in signing some elite-level hitters on the international market, they weren’t afraid to go after Martinez, whom they signed for $600,000 in January 2023, adding to a class headlined by Felnin Celesten. In Martinez's two stops heading into 2025, the Dominican Summer League and the Arizona Complex League, he showed his raw stuff can get hitters out -- when he knows where it’s going. He struggled to find consistency for much of his first taste of full-season ball this year, but was having his best month in July when he was sent to the Pirates in the Caleb Ferguson trade. There are still plenty of reasons to be high on Martinez: his athleticism, his size -- he’s 6-foot-4 -- and his power stuff. The teenaged right-hander has seen velocity gains in the early stages of his career, and his fastball now sits around 94-95 mph and touches the upper 90s, and he can really sink it to get ground-ball outs. While his changeup was his better secondary pitch in the DSL, his slider has now caught up and surpassed it. In the DSL, Martinez did a nice job of being in and around the strike zone, even with his upticks in velocity. He didn’t replicate that when he came stateside and his command issues after walking seven batters per nine in the ACL -- and 5.5 per nine in the California League at the time of the trade -- have raised some reliever-risk flags. He's pitched all of the 2025 season at age 19, so there’s no reason to restrict him just yet, but he’ll need to seriously refine his command to remain in a rotation.

He made his U.S. debut last May but needed just three starts in Rookie-ball to merit a promotion to Single-A four days after his 18th birthday. He logged a 3.12 ERA with 58 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings as the youngest starter in the Florida State League. Extremely advanced for his age, Benitez already owns a plus low-80s changeup with significant fade and sink. He has added 20 pounds since turning pro, boosting his two- and four-seam fastballs into the low 90s with a peak of 96 mph, though both could use more consistent action. He improved the shape of his upper-70s slider last year, turning it into a sweeper that should become a solid pitch once it gains more power. With a quick arm and explosive movement down the mound, Benitez creates more extension than most 6-foot-1 hurlers. His control and command can waver at times, but he's athletic and repeats his delivery well, so he should gain more consistency as he gets stronger. Another member of Miami's deep stable of potential lefty starters, he could fit in the middle of a big league rotation once he's fully developed.

Soto received $250,000 to be that arm and he was still only 16 when he made his professional debut in the Dominican Summer League. While his surface numbers looked good (like his 1.64 ERA), his youth and lack of velocity led to the Angels erring on the side of caution and sending him back to the DSL, where added strength and stuff led to even better results in 2024. After packing some weight onto his 6-foot-2 frame, Soto's velocity jumped from sitting 86-89 mph and touching 92 to more in the 92-94 mph range and topping out at 97. At first it seemed like his 82-85 mph changeup was his best secondary offering, but more power behind his curve -- now up to 77-80 mph from the low 70s in 2023 -- might have caught it up to the cambio. Both have chances to be solid-to-average pitches for the right-hander. In addition to missing a fair amount of bats overall, Soto improved his feel for the strike zone, cut his walk rate down considerably in 2024 and is showing some feel for pitch usage. All of this has added excitement over what he might do for an encore as he pitches in the United States for the first time this season.

But that jumped to 94-98 mph when the Rays saw him one last time before international signing day in 2023. He still signed for a $210,000 bonus, a modest sum for an international prospect with that kind of arm talent, and bypassed the Dominican Summer League to pitch in the United States at age 17 with no professional experience. Urbina’s results were fine, if uninspiring, through two seasons spent mostly in the Florida Complex League. He posted a 4.87 ERA with 78 strikeouts and 41 walks in his first 88 2/3 innings as a pro. But he is still stunningly young, and he’ll spend this whole season as a 19-year-old. And he still has stuff to dream on, with a big-time fastball in the mid-90s (touching triple-digits), a sweeping breaking ball and a changeup that has occasionally flashed plus. Urbina averaged nearly five walks per nine innings in the Complex League, although he cut back on that (while giving up more homers) during his brief stint in Charleston last year. That's a trend that has carried into 2025, and thanks to heavy whiffs on the slider, his strikeouts have picked up as well. There's less of a reliever risk now in Urbina's age-19 season, leading to him surging up the rankings.

That’s where Noah Schultz -- now the top left-handed pitching prospect in the game after the White Sox took him in the first round of that Draft -- and Izzi were teammates. Izzi showed enough for the Mariners to take him in the fourth round, going over slot with $1.1 million to sign him away from his Wichita State commitment. It was a slow rollout for the right-hander, not pitching after signing and throwing just 18 1/3 innings in the Arizona Complex League in 2023. But the gloves came off in 2024 and Izzi threw well, topping 100 IP for full-season Modesto. After opening 2025 with an oblique injury, he came into his own by midsummer and was then dealt to the Diamondbacks as part of the Deadline deal for Josh Naylor. Izzi is pitching at age 21 for the 2025 season, and the 6-foot-3 right-hander built a pretty good foundation to work from. His fastball typically sits at least 94 mph and can touch as high as 97 at times, and he does a very good job of separating his four-seamer up in the zone and his sinking two-seamer down. His low-80s sweeper has the chance to be a solid pitch that misses bats. He didn’t have a great feel for his changeup with Modesto. Whether that necessitates a move to the bullpen remains to be seen, although there is some thought that because of his excellent separation between his two fastballs, he might be able to stay in a rotation without a changeup. His splits were near-even before the trade, and his control had shown steady improvement, aiding the belief that he should still get rotation looks with Arizona.

But he made a big leap forward in 2024, proving quickly he was too good for the DSL in his second go-around there before finishing the year with four starts at Single-A Delmarva as an 18-year-old. He racked up 49 strikeouts over 32 2/3 innings across the two levels, the equivalent of 13.5 strikeouts per nine. Morfe surprised a lot of evaluators with his ascent last summer and has surprisingly high-octane stuff for a pitcher his size. He only stands around 5-foot-8 but can dial his fastball up near triple digits, and it consistently lives in the upper 90s. What Morfe lacks in height he makes up for in athleticism and flexibility, using those qualities in tandem with a whippy arm to generate velocity that belies his size. His two secondary offerings are both hard, too: a mid-80s sweeping slider that can miss bats and a low-90s changeup with fade. The change especially showed big improvement last summer, going from a fringy offering to a potential plus pitch. It’s an advanced arsenal in an unpolished package, as Morfe’s command remains a work in progress. That’s not unusual for a young power pitcher, and Morfe was better at throwing strikes last year than his stats might imply because they were skewed by one ugly blow up start at the very end of the season. His three plus pitches and bulldog mentality remind some evaluators of Carlos Martinez, but to reach that ceiling, Morfe will need to prove he can throw enough strikes and that his body can handle a starter’s workload.

Curtis gave up a commitment to Barry University (Fla.) to turn pro for $125,000 in 2022, working just 6 2/3 innings in his pro debut the following summer because he was too wild. His control was still sporadic last year but he posted a 2.85 ERA with a .194 average-against at Single-A. Much of Curtis’ success stems from his high-spin low-80s changeup that dives and fades under barrels, generating a 56 percent swing-and-miss rate in 2024. He also does a good job of spinning a solid upper-70s curveball and a tight low-80s slider that get chases but landed in the zone only a third of the time last year. His fastball has some carry but misses few bats, sitting in the low 90s and topping out at 96 mph in the early innings but parking at 88-90 by the middle frames. While Curtis is a good athlete, he has yet to figure out how to harness his stuff. He could become a No. 4 starter if he gets stronger and discovers more strikes, though he also has to prove he can do more than trick Single-A hitters with his array of secondary pitches. Texas will continue to be patient with his development.

Harris, Harris played three years at High Point as a third baseman/right-hander before his elbow gave out in 2021 and required Tommy John surgery. He transferred to NCAA Division II UNC Pembroke, missed most of the next season before performing well as a two-way player in 2023, going undrafted in large part because he was 24 years old. Signed as a nondrafted free agent for $10,000 after he earned Coastal Plain League pitcher of the year accolades that summer while topping the circuit with a 0.30 ERA, he posted a 1.52 ERA and a 36 percent strikeout rate while advancing to Double-A in his first year-plus as a pro. Harris's fastball explodes on hitters, coming out of an over-the-top arm slot and arriving at 94-97 mph with tremendous carry and riding action. His 79-82 mph curveball and 83-85 mph slider both play very well off his heater thanks to their quality depth, with his curve slightly more effective and grading as well above-average at times. He has shown a low-80s changeup with some fade and tumble in the past but has mostly scrapped it in pro ball. Harris is athletic and gets down the mound extremely well, creating a combination of a high slot and quality extension that is highly unusual. He has provided strikes throughout his college and pro career, and he shouldn't need much more time in the Minors.

The Rangers thought he had one of the best sinkers in that Draft and selected him in the 12th round. In his first full pro season, he compiled a 3.64 ERA with 95 strikeouts in 89 innings between two Class A stops. Bonzagni’s two-seam fastball operates at 92-94 mph and tops out at 96 while burrowing at the plate, and its heavy sink is the reason why he posted an excellent 2.0 groundout/airout ratio in his first two pro seasons. He also throws a four-seamer that reaches 98 mph with more armside run and carry. He gets good depth on a sweeping low-80s slider, giving him a solid second offering. A good athlete, Bonzagni repeats his simple side-step delivery and provides a steady stream of strikes. He has yet to show much feel for his too-firm changeup in the mid-80s and almost never uses it. He’ll project more as a sinker/slider multi-inning reliever unless he can refine his cambio, but he might advance quickly in that role.

But after posting the Draft League’s best fastball velocity, the right-hander signed with the Cardinals for $500,000 in July 2023, thus becoming St. Louis’ first player signed out of Taiwan. He opened his first full season at Single-A Palm Beach and dominated the Florida State League with a 2.79 ERA and 123 strikeouts in 116 innings. Lin was the only Palm Beach pitcher to exceed 100 mph in 2024, and he did it 12 times and touched 101 on May 25. He typically stayed more in the 95-98 mph range with his four-seamer, and while the heater had ample armside run, it didn’t come with great ride, causing it to play below the velo. His 86-89 mph changeup was a much better whiff-heavy pitch with 50.8 percent of swings coming up empty against it. The separation off the fastball and similar horizontal movement befuddled many hitters. Lin could also work in a mid-80s slider, but without high spin rates, it will likely be less effective higher up the chain. None of Lin’s pitches averaged gloveside break in the FSL, and that will be a focus entering year two. For a pitcher who once walked 24 batters in 15 2/3 innings in the Northwoods League, Lin showed a spectacular turnaround when it came to control in the FSL with just a 7.8 percent BB rate. That will be challenged against more patient hitters at High-A and above, but entering his age-23 season, Lin is more raw than many arms his age and could continue to hone his sharpness on the mound.

He put up a 2.79 ERA with a 26.6/7.8 K%/BB% in 116 IP at Single-A. The fastball sits 96.4 MPH and he has a diverse pitch mix with multiple bat missing secondaries (change, splitter, slider). He’s still a bit on the raw side overall, as evidenced by the fact that he’s already 23 and pitched the entire season at Single-A last year. The K/BB rate was good at the level, but it wasn’t really off the charts like you would want to see from a 22 year old with nasty stuff.

Combined at the three levels, he posted a 3.88 ERA in 27 games (15 starts) with 137 strikeouts and 40 walks over 99 2/3 innings. Johnston appears to have a much better feel for his three-pitch mix than he did in college. His fastball velocity typically varies from 89-94 mph and can touch up to 96. His split-changeup flashes plus as it continues developing as a true out pitch. His low-80s slider is improving but still a work in progress as it sometimes gives off the look of a slurvy-type offering. Big-bodied at 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, Johnston has the size and arsenal to stay in a starting role, something that may have seemed like a long shot before he was drafted. His strike-throwing ability has clearly improved as a professional, which helped him quickly rise through multiple levels last season. Maintaining that control along with tightening up the breaking ball as a solid third pitch will be the keys to developing into a possible back-end rotation piece, with a floor of a multi-inning lefty reliever out of the bullpen.

The Marlins signed him for a below-slot $4.5 million as the 10th overall pick, then used the savings to float the 2023 Draft's best southpaw (Thomas White) down to the supplemental first round. They pitched together at two levels in their first full pro season, with White outpitching Meyer after they advanced to High-A. Meyer's high-spin slider can be a wipeout pitch at its best, sitting at 83-85 mph with two-plane break, though he tends to fall in love with it at the expense of developing his other secondary offerings. He worked at 93-95 mph and topped out at 98 with his fastball in 2024 after throwing a tick or two harder as an amateur. While his heater has plenty of armside run, it doesn't stand out in terms of carry or approach angle and gets hit hard when he didn't locate it well. Meyer's fading 83-85 mph changeup and downer 77-79 mph curveball both show flashes of becoming solid pitches if he'll trust them more and do a better job of landing them for strikes. He has an athletic delivery that he repeats well and was known for his polish as an amateur, but he issued 62 walks in 85 innings during his first two years as a pro. He may need more time to develop than expected but still has the upside to pitch in the front half of a big league rotation.

He was better at Single-A, but it still came with a 16.3% BB% in 34 IP. That is just an insanely high walk rate over 74 IP, and it’s really hard to overlook as much as I want to overlook it. Maybe if it came with mid to upper 90’s heat, it would be easier, but the fastball sat more low to mid 90’s this year. The reason I want to overlook the poor numbers, is because Meyer still looks like that electric, hyped pitching prospect when you watch him. He’s a projectable and athletic 6’5” who most certainly looks the part. And while the fastball velocity wasn’t off the charts, it explodes out of his hand and is a bat missing weapon. He combines the fastball with a potentially plus to double plus slider and a lesser used, but good changeup. The ingredients and eye test are definitely here to still be a top of the rotation starter, but he clearly has a ways to go with his control/command to get there. I can definitely see scenarios where I would prefer him over Agustin Ramirez and De Los Santos, so placing him 2nd on this list wouldn’t be unreasonable at all. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 12/3.87/1.31/180 in 170 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2551020408163265,0.3979591836734694,0.40816326530612246,0.336734693877551,34.24,67.85714285714286,63.63636363636363,,67.20321931589537,3,0.75,61.37048897664059,43.73567114182421,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.2749999999999986,65.29999999999998,70.0,41.747701342547266,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,42.84646560414627,sa3022945,playerId

He headed to Gulf Coast State (Fla.) JC, where Chicago landed him a year later with their fifth-round choice. Considerably raw when he turned pro, he has impressed with his stuff and improved polish during his full-season debut in 2025. Oppor operates at 93-95 mph and peaks at 98 with his fastball, and he's doing a better job of holding his velocity and commanding his heater this season. His 78-82 mph slider features so much sweeping action that he has trouble throwing it for strikes or getting chases, but it generates a lot of empty swings when he lands it in the zone. He does a nice job of killing spin and pounding the zone with an upper-70s changeup that drops at the plate, and he's willing to throw it two or three times in a row to keep hitters off balance. While Oppor's fastball doesn't feature a lot of life, he creates deception with a low three-quarters arm slot, low release height and somewhat upright delivery. He has cut his walk rate in half from 2024 to 2025 while showing the ability to miss bats with his entire arsenal. He'll need time to develop but is becoming one of the most promising young pitchers in the system.

After posting a 3.74 ERA with 100 strikeouts in 89 innings, he went to the Cardinals in the eighth round that summer and signed for slightly above slot at $230,000. The southpaw enjoyed a solid first full season with Single-A Palm Beach and High-A Peoria (2.34 ERA, 105 K in 104 IP) and rounded out the campaign with 12 more innings in the Arizona Fall League. He’s opened 2025 with Double-A Springfield. The 6-foot-2 hurler has shown a velocity bump at the start of his second full season that has brought his fastball to the 93-94 mph range, touching 96. Even when it averaged a little lower than that, the heater still played up with a flat approach out of a fairly deceptive three-quarters arm slot. He has to keep that fastball up, however, because upper-level hitters will crush it if it’s thrown in the heart of the zone. Henderson has also leaned more heavily on a 79-82 mph sweeping slider, breaking it away from lefties and backfooting righties, and he's folded in an upper-80s cutter to bridge his repertoire. As part of that arsenal alteration, his upper-70s curveball, which can be overly loopy, has taken a backseat, while a mid-80s changeup is reserved solely for righties. Henderson has an easy delivery, and dating back to the Draft, scouts had hoped that he could add velo with more pro instruction. His walk numbers suffered a little the higher he climbed in ’24, but he should still have at least average control, helping his chances of being a backend starter.

He was able to jump on a slightly faster developmental track by pitching his way from High-A to Double-A in his first full season, topping all Braves pitching prospects in a host of categories, from innings pitched and strikeouts to K-BB percentage and xFIP. Braun may not have wow stuff, but he sure has a lot of it with a bit of a kitchen sink-type approach to pitching. The six-footer now has as many as five pitches he mixes well to keep hitters guessing. His four-seamer averaged 93 mph in 2024 and topped out at 95 mph with some arm-side run to it and he added a two-seamer with sink at the end of the season and into instructional league play. His 83-84 mph slider is his go-to secondary offering and it elicited a 39-percent miss rate last year, and he also mixes in an upper-70s curve and mid-80s changeup effectively. All of Braun’s stuff plays up because he can throw any pitch for strikes, with a 67-percent strike rate in 2024, and it was encouraging to see him be more effective as he moved up a level with the promotion to Double-A. He doesn’t have that high of a ceiling because of the lack of big stuff, but his feel for pitching gives him a pretty high floor, with a chance to be a solid back-end starter in the big leagues.

The Explorers dropped baseball before he could pitch for them, so he transferred to Towson and blossomed into a sixth-round pick in 2023. He won the Astros' Minor League pitcher of the year award in his first full pro season, compiling a 3.47 ERA, .219 opponent average and 125 strikeouts in 96 innings while rising from Single-A to Double-A. Since turning pro, Pecko has added 2 mph to his best pitch, a 92-94 mph fastball that touches 96 and misses bats thanks to its flat approach angle and carry. He has replaced a sweeping slider with a tighter low-80s version that he also can turn into an upper-80s cutter, both of which are average offerings with the potential to get better. His 78-82 mph curveball and mid-80s changeup offer more depth, but both grade as fringy. Pecko gains deception with a low three-quarters arm slot and the extension in his delivery. Strong and athletic, he repeats his mechanics well and improved his control and command as he rose through the system in 2024. He's a potential No. 4 starter if he can execute his spin pitches better and develop a second better-than-average weapon.

The New Jersey native was having a solid first full season with High-A Greensboro when he was dealt to the Orioles in a prospect-for-prospect deal for Billy Cook at the 2024 Trade Deadline, and he pitched to a 3.73 ERA at Double-A over his first eight appearances with his new organization. He made just three outings with Double-A Chesapeake in 2025 before being shut down with an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery in May. A 6-foot-3 right-hander with a power arsenal, Reilly's ultimate role once he returns to action will be based on his ability to command his high-octane stuff. He's been dogged by fringy control since college, where a consistently high walk rate led Reilly to pitch mostly out of the bullpen. His high-spin fastball flashes as high as 100 mph in relief and sits comfortably in the low-to-mid-90s as a starter, and he uses its impressive induced vertical break to generate a ton of whiffs up in the zone. Reilly compliments the heater with a power slider that he can morph into a cutter against lefties, and he played around with a bigger sweeper and a gyro-type changeup after the trade. Either could develop into average offerings with more usage. Reilly's high-effort delivery is at the root of his difficulty throwing strikes, notably a high arm slot that gives his pitches more movement but also makes his mechanics tough to replicate. Though the walk rate crept back up with the Orioles, they were going to give him a chance to develop into a back-end starter even if his profile hints at an eventual move back to the 'pen, especially post-surgery, where his stuff could play even better in short stints.

He split time between the rotation and bullpen as a freshman in 2021, became the Wildcats’ Friday starter in '22 and truly struggled in his Draft year (8.27 ERA, 1.60 WHIP in 57 2/3 innings), leading to a move back to relief. He went to the Rays in the sixth round in 2023 and signed for roughly slot at $304,800. Nichols steadied the ship as a starter for Single-A Charleston last year (2.90 ERA, 66 SO in 71 1/3 IP) and has been a breakout arm for High-A Bowling Green in his age-23 season. The 6-foot-5 right-hander brings plenty of velocity with a 95-97 mph fastball that can touch 99. The offering doesn’t come with standout movement, however, and it can be pounded by batters able to catch up to the heat, making it play down. A mid-80s slider breaks well horizontally and vertically and has been Nichols’ putaway pitch, helping his K rate take a nice jump this summer. He shows a changeup, too, with roughly 10 mph separation off the heater. He sells it well with his arm speed, leading to whiffs, but it trails the other two pitches in overall usage. Nichols has filled up the zone a ton in pro ball, leading to a walk rate around just five percent in the first half of 2025, but it’s control over command. Batters have teed off enough on his pitches in the heart of the zone to the point where his walk and home run totals have been equal at times with Bowling Green. He might still end up in a bullpen to see how much more velo he can squeeze out, but his starter chances are better now than they were on Draft Day.

He pitched four innings that summer before getting his first extended taste of pro ball in 2024, when he led the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League with 63 strikeouts in 46 innings and was named its pitcher of the year. Shipped to the Giants for Alex Cobb at the Trade Deadline, he looked tired while finishing the season in Single-A. Bresnahan added fastball velocity in his first full year as a pro, operating at 91-94 mph and touching 96 with riding action that enticed a lot of chases in the ACL. His best secondary pitch is a mid-80s changeup with significant fade when it's on, though he's still learning to throw it for strikes. His low-80s slider has some sweeping action and has gained consistency in 2025. Bresnahan uses his 6-foot-4 frame and athleticism to move down the mound well and create a lot of extension in his delivery. The next step will be to add more muscle to his projectable build so he can maintain his stuff and mechanics over the course of a long pro season. He has the ceiling of at least a No. 4 starter, perhaps more if his pitches add more power as he gains strength.

In 2019, it was third-rounder Jack Kochanowicz, who got nearly twice over slot. In 2021, they got Mason Albright for seven figures in Round 12. It was Caden Dana’s turn in 2022 ($1.5 million) and the following year came Kent, the Texas prepster who signed for nearly $1 million as an eighth-rounder. His first full season of pro ball was up-and-down, though he topped 100 innings pitched for Single-A Inland Empire as a teenager. During his first full season, Kent largely used a three-pitch mix to attack California League hitters. He can run his fastball up to 95-96 mph, sitting a little below that, and it might be at its best when he sinks it with decent downhill plane and armside run. He relies on it too much, throwing it nearly 70 percent of the time a year ago, so he’ll have to start throwing his slider and changeup more. The mid-80s slider is inconsistent, but it misses bats and has the best chance to become a true out pitch. He has some feel for his low-80s changeup with fade, and he still has an upper-70s curve but didn’t go to it often. In addition to varying his pitch mix, Kent needs to work on his overall command after walking 4.9 per nine a year ago. There’s a starting pitching kit in here with some upside as he pitches all of 2025 at age 20.

He lasted a bit longer than expected and the Giants were delighted to grab him with their supplemental second-round choice at No. 69 overall. He divided his first full pro season between two Class A levels, logging a 4.63 ERA with a 108/37 K/BB ratio in 103 innings. All three of Whitman's pitches grade as at least solid at their best, highlighted by a low-80s slider with horizontal and vertical movement that he commands better than his fastball. He does a good job of locating his heater too, operating at 92-94 mph and touching 97 with riding and tailing action. His low-80s changeup lacks the consistency of his fastball and slider but still misses bats with its fade and sink. Whitman couldn't find the strike zone at Purdue but cleaned up his mechanics at Kent State and now has a more fluid delivery. He struggled with his control in the first half of last season but sliced his walk rate from 12 percent in Single-A to 5 percent in High-A. A legitimate three-pitch starter, he could fit into the middle of a big league rotation if he continues to improve his changeup and strike-throwing.

Then came Hamm, Detroit’s fifth-round pick from the 2023 Draft after a solid but unspectacular career at Middle Tennessee State. The Tigers signed him for below slot, had him throw more high fastballs, worked with him on developing a slider, then saw him dominate hitters at High-A West Michigan for his first full pro season. He posted a 0.96 ERA, .188 batting average and 51-to-6 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his first 10 outings before hitters began to adjust. He seemed to wear down over the home stretch but still finished with impressive ratios of 11.1 K/9 and 6.6 H/9. Hamm doesn’t look imposing at 6-foot-1, but his high arm angle allows his fastball to play up at the top of the zone. His velocity sat 92-95 mph in 2024 but has been down a few ticks (while maintaining the elite ride) while he's worked around an IL stint this summer. While the high heaters set up his buckling curveball, his slider has more horizontal movement than vertical, going in on left-handed hitters and away from righties. His changeup works as an occasional look but has upside. While he has the stuff and command to get through a lineup multiple times, the physical riggers of his first full pro season took their toll on his fastball and set him off-balance. Hamm has the range and grasp of pitches to reach the big leagues, but how he maintains his pitches over a full season could determine whether he slots in as a starter or eventually moves into the bullpen.

And he’s not just stats, he has the talent to back it up with a plus low to mid 90’s fastball and plus slider, to go along with an average change and curve. He combines that with about average control. He never made it to Double-A for even a cup of coffee, and I would really like to see how the profile plays against upper minors hitters before really flying him up the rankings, because I have a feeling that K rate is coming down against better competition. I see more #3/4 fantasy starter upside, but if his control/command takes a step forward, or he gains more velocity, or the changeup takes a step forward, he can beat that projection. – 2025 Projection: 1/4.35/1.34/24 in 30 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.90/1.25/160 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.26490066225165565,0.1456953642384106,0.6291390728476821,0.304635761589404,31.93,68.96551724137932,41.666666666666664,,59.758551307847085,3,0.75,52.85943942900132,39.25530380015046,1.0,1–2 yr,-0.4277778000000012,55.133333600000014,70.0,37.608091180045136,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,38.95030775102032,sa3023134,playerId

That limited his workload, and he actually threw more innings (37) in the 2022 summer in the Alaska League than he did in any of his campaigns on campus. The Royals selected him in the 16th round of the 2023 Draft, signed him for $150,000 (the max allowed without dipping into their bonus pool) and got him work at Single-A Columbia in his first full season, again mostly in relief. Hansell transitioned to starting full-time in 2025 with mostly positive results at Single-A and High-A. The former Sun Devil certainly has size at 6-foot-6, and he can run his fastball up to 97 mph, though he generally sits 92-94. That’s almost perfectly average velocity these days, but it’s the curveball that’s the clear star of the show in the arsenal. Hansell throws impressive 77-80 mph curves that bend aesthetically downward for consistent whiffs against batters from both sides. A mid-80s slider can give a harder breaking look to righties, and his changeup (right around the same velo band) continues to be an area of focus. Hansell’s walk rate ballooned in his introduction to the Midwest League, and the lack of a cambio led to some drastic splits in '25. The Royals believe his limited workload in college gives him a longer runway than the typical 23-year-old, and he could certainly use the reps to keep honing his stuff. At the least, he could sit in the upper 90s more often in relief and really rely on the curve to dominate in those shorter spurts.

JC, Hicks transferred to South Carolina for the 2022 season but blew out his elbow in his second start and had Tommy John surgery that March. The Orioles still selected him in the 15th round, but he returned to pitch well in a variety of roles for the Gamecocks the following spring before signing with the Astros as a 13th-rounder. He demonstrated some of the best command in the system while reaching Double-A midway through his first full pro season last year. Hicks' best pitches are his low-90s two-seam fastball with sink and a mid-80s changeup with fade and depth. Since turning pro, he has added a slightly harder four-seamer and a low-80s slider with more sweep to an arsenal that also includes a curveball in the upper 70s and a more traditional slide piece in the low 80s. His breaking stuff pales in comparison to the rest of his repertoire. None of Hicks' six offerings grades as better than average, but they work because he sequences them well and works all four quadrants of the strike zone. His low three-quarters slot creates wide angle and a flat approach trajectory that provides deception. He's on track to help the Astros as a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever sooner than initially expected.

His sweeping slider can be effective, but he doesn’t locate it as well as his other two offerings. The Rockies will be sure to bring Sullivan along slowly and manage his workload as he’s coming back from the hip issue, but he’s already defied expectations thanks to confidence in his pitch usage, his unusual mechanics and his extreme strike-throwing ways. He’ll be at the upper levels continuing to show that his unusual profile just might work in a big league rotation.

He also throws a good slider and changeup, so it’s not like he has nothing else, but it’s super hard for me to bet on this kind of stuff, especially if he hasn’t proven it in the upper minors yet.

The same issue dogged him while he posted a 6.34 ERA in three college seasons at Lamar and Houston, but he has enjoyed much more consistent success since the Marlins drafted him in the 12th round in 2023 and made him a full-time reliever. He compiled a 1.91 ERA, .164 opponent average and 83 strikeouts in 66 innings while reaching Double-A in his first full pro season. Ekness unleashes 96-98 mph and reaches 100 with armside run on his fastball, showing the ability to produce carry up in the zone or sink at the knees. His heaters elicit plenty of chases and swings and misses, and his sinking version can be downright unhittable. His slider combines mid-80s power with horizontal and vertical action, though he struggles to land it in the zone. While Ekness creates deception with a low three-quarters arm slot and crossfire in his delivery, he also throws with some effort and his mechanics impede his control. He did cut his walk rate from 16 percent in college to 10 percent last year, encouraging progress. He could become a high-leverage reliever if he can harness his slider and provide more strikes.

Drafted by the Mets in the third round of the 2023 Draft, he began his first full professional campaign last season at Single-A St. Lucie and was promoted to High-A Brooklyn after six starts before getting sent to the A’s at the Trade Deadline in exchange for right-hander Paul Blackburn. Between Single-A, High-A and even a couple of outings with Triple-A Las Vegas, he combined for a 4.50 ERA with 121 strikeouts and 45 walks over 136 innings. Morris runs up his four-seam fastball to about 95-96 mph and also throws a sinker with good arm-side run in the 92-95 range. His mid-80s slider has developed into an above-average secondary offering. His mid-70s curveball provides a good variation of pitch speeds, though he is still working to make it a more consistent pitch, along with his improving upper-80s changeup. Morris is athletic with his 6-foot-3 frame. His competitive drive stands out whenever he takes the mound. Discovering the right arm slot that allows for the most consistency is the next big step in his development. How that pans out as he moves through the system will likely determine his long-term role, though he profiles as a back-end starter given his overall pitch mix and solid control.

After the Red Sox drafted him in the 12th round that July, he didn't make his pro debut until the end of the 2023 season. He posted a 3.94 ERA with 118 strikeouts in 89 High-A innings last year and earned a swift promotion to Double-A in 2025. Mullins' fastball operates in the low 90s and tops out at 95 mph, yet it misses plenty of bats because it features tremendous carry up in the strike zone. He'll flash a plus low-80s slider with two-plane depth at times and can turn it into a harder, tighter cutter that's similarly effective. His low-80s changeup lacks the consistency of his other offerings but has quality tumble at its best and helps him keep right-handers in check. Mullins' delivery comes with a big leg kick, a twist that hides the ball behind him and a low release point, all of which help him create deception. He exhibited fringy control in college and during his first full pro season, so he'll need to improve his strike-throwing to become a No. 4 or 5 starter. If not, he could have a future as a multi-inning lefty reliever.

Wehunt added a little velocity and missed more bats with his fastball as a pro, operating at 92-94 mph and touching 96 while showing the ability to carry it by hitters at the letters or leverage it down in the zone for grounders. He has switched from a low-80s changeup in college to a mid-80s splitter in pro ball, and it could become a plus pitch if he learns to harness it better. He threw his sweeping low-80s slider almost as much as his heater last year, and he also can morph it into an upper-80s cutter. Wehunt is more athletic than most 6-foot-7, 240 pounders and gets down the mound extremely well, producing plenty of extension that allows his pitches to get on hitters quickly. He keeps his long limbs in sync and repeats his three-quarters delivery well, providing consistent strikes. Boston believes he can add more strength to his frame and more power to his pitches, which would enhance his chances of becoming a No. 4 starter.

He opened eyes with a standout freshman season, regressed as a sophomore and was suspended for his junior year, signing with the Orioles as an undrafted free agent after a stint in the Cape Cod League in 2023. He made one appearance in Rookie ball before making an impact full-season debut in 2024, racking up 118 strikeouts in 92 innings across two levels and finishing at High-A Aberdeen. At 6-foot-5 and 240 pounds, Gibson is a right-hander with a power-pitcher build and his success last year rested on the return of his power stuff. His fastball averages 94-95 mph, though he was consistently revving it up into the high 90s by the end of the year. A mid-80s sweeping slider is the best of his secondary offerings; he also throws a low-80s curve, a high-80s cutter and a developing changeup, all of which can miss bats and have the chance to turn into at least average pitches. He’s a fairly good strike thrower for a power pitcher, though his command can still get away from him at times. It’ll be important to see how durable Gibson can be after adding velocity over the course of last year, but if he can prove health and build his workload, he has a chance to grow into a big league rotation piece. It’s also easy to see him emerging as a leverage reliever given his power stuff and swing-and-miss weapons, assuming they would play up in shorter stints.

They signed him away from a Vanderbilt commitment for $4.1 million, the equivalent of mid-first-round money and a record for a New England draftee. He proved more polished than expected in his first full pro season, logging a 2.81 ERA with a 120/38 K/BB ratio in 96 innings between two Class A stops and earning top prospect accolades in the High-A Midwest League. White's stuff made a jump in 2024, with his fastball velocity increasing from 92-95 mph to 94-97 with plenty of carry and run. He has always exhibited good feel for spin and switched from a 78-82 mph curveball with depth to an 81-85 slider with significant horizontal action. His fading mid-80s changeup is at least a solid offering and keeps right-handers honest. White is just 20 and is still learning how to keep his long limbs and delivery in sync, though he threw more strikes following his promotion to High-A in late May. Given the quality of his stuff, he doesn't have to locate his pitches with precision, but if his control and command continue to improve, he could become a No. 1 starter. He continues to add strength to his 6-foot-5 frame, so his stuff could keep improving as well.

He’s a built up 6’5” lefty with such dominant stuff that he basically slept walked through the lower minors. He quickly got the call to High-A and put up a 2.61 ERA with a 29.9/8.3 K%/BB% in 62 IP. He throws from an easy and athletic three quarter arm slot delivery which he uses to fire a mid 90’s fastball that completely overpowered lower minors hitters. He also has a plus breaking ball that he will use in any count to go along with a lesser used, but still very good changeup. He’s not a finished product as he’ll have some bouts of control problems, and he needs to continue to refine all 3 of his pitches really, but for his first year out of high school, that is an insanely impressive first full year of pro ball. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 14/3.39/1.15/215 in 185 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9661016949152542,0.9830508474576272,0.288135593220339,0.9745762711864406,82.16,100.0,90.9090909090909,,91.14688128772636,3,0.75,86.65474128191609,83.73315944867062,1.0,0–1 yr,-4.4944445,100.0,70.0,85.30794783460118,20.0,0.6799999999999999,SP,69.38857652557053,sa3023268,playerId

After signing below slot at $225,000, Wenninger opened his first full season with Single-A St. Lucie, where he fanned 89 batters in 71 2/3 innings, and was promoted to High-A Brooklyn in July before posting a 3.12 ERA in 43 1/3 innings there. The right-hander’s 140 strikeouts between both spots were second-most in the New York organization behind Jonah Tong’s 160. Throwing from a high three-quarters arm angle, Wenninger will touch the occasional 96 mph but typically sits in the 91-94 range with a fastball that comes with some armside run. The best thing his heater might do, however, is set up his 82-84 mph splitter. The offspeed offering comes with roughly the same amount of horizontal movement but gets good separation and drop compared to the fastball. Wenninger leaned on the split often as he began his pro career but folded in a sweeper, cutter and curveball more at High-A with solid results. The former Fighting Illini should have enough control to keep getting starting looks as he climbs toward Queens, and his reverse splits keep him interesting too. Mets instructors have worked with him on deepening his arsenal with a sinker and gyro slider to see what can stick beyond the fastball-splitter combination. The depth of that arsenal will be challenged in the Majors, but he's more than holding his own in his first jump into the upper Minors.

His first full pro season ended last August when a line drive struck him in the face, costing him the vision in his right eye, but he was able to open this year in High-A. He continues to display impressive stuff, though he still requires a lot more polish. Copen touched 99 mph but worked at 91-94 with his fastball in his final college season, and he now operates at 95-97 mph with a four-seamer with a low release height and carry that make it even more difficult to hit. His mid-80s slider and low-90s cutter are plus offerings at their best and the latter tops out at 95 mph. He hasn't shown much feel for a mid-80s changeup with some fading action. Because Copen works with a long arm action with a deep plunge in the back, he struggles to keep his delivery in sync. He has no history of throwing strikes and his walk rate has risen slightly since he turned pro. His stuff gives him the upside of a mid-rotation starter but his more realistic ceiling is likely as a late-inning reliever unless he dramatically improves his control.

He moved on to Dallas Baptist for his senior season and threw well enough for the Orioles to take him in the eighth round of the 2023 Draft as a money-saving senior sign, joining the organization for an under-slot bonus of $100,000. He really didn’t land on any radars for most of his first full season, spent at Single-A in his age-23 campaign, with a 4.45 ERA through July. He opened some eyes by posting a 1.14 ERA and .208 BAA over his final six starts, then really emerged in 2025, quickly pitching his way to (and excelling with) Double-A Chesapeake, before Tommy John surgery in July derailed his progress. The Orioles are excited about how Bragg has been using a solid four-pitch mix at the upper levels. His fastball averages around 95 mph and flirts with triple-digits, per Synergy. He backs that heater up with three secondaries which all can miss bats: a low-80s slider, mid-80s changeup and a cutter that he cranks up into the upper 80s. Making all of this stuff more interesting is that he’s shown the ability to land them all for strikes and is missing bats at a higher rate than he did in college while keeping his walks low. It’s still a relatively small sample size from a pitcher without a long track record of amateur success, but the Orioles might have a legitimate starting pitcher on their hands once he returns from surgery.

The industry had the big right-hander pegged for more like a 5th-7th round pick, but the Braves liked him more than that, taking him in the second round. So far, it’s looking like they were right as Hackenberg pitched his way from High-A to Triple-A in his first full season, leading qualified Braves arms in ERA and batting average against. With as many as five pitches at his disposal, Hackenberg has provided an intriguing combination of missing bats and getting groundball outs in the Minors. He throws both a four- and two-seam fastball, with the former up to 97 and averaging 94.7 mph last year and the latter averaging over 93 mph and leading to high groundball rates. He was sinker heavy in college but started to feature the four-seamer up in the zone more in pro ball with solid results. His best secondary offering is his power two-plane curve that can miss bats, though his changeup also got some swing-and-miss along with weak groundball contact, and he mixes in a hard 90-mph cutter as well. The most encouraging thing with Hackenberg was that his stuff got better and he threw harder as the year went on despite blowing by his season innings high from college. His strike-throwing hasn’t been as consistent as it was with the Hokies, but there’s confidence he’ll be in and around the zone enough to be an innings-eating workhorse in a big league rotation.

He’s a built up 6’2”, 220 pounds with mid 90’s heat, a diverse pitch mix, and a bat missing secondary in his curve.

They dipped into the prep pitcher market for the first time in Round 4 when they took Baumann out of Florida power Hagerty High School and going over slot to sign him away from Central Florida. He had a very successful first full season in pro ball, finishing with just under 100 innings pitched and touching High-A while spending most of the year at age 19. Baumann is a surprising strike-thrower given his enormous 6-foot-8 frame, with all of his stuff trending in the right direction. He landed his fastball, which averaged around 94 mph for the 2024 season and touched 98, for a strike 72 percent of the time and he did that while working on improving his fastball shape. Baumann entered pro ball relying on a sinker and early in 2024, he would sink the heater at times and have it have carry others, without rhyme or reason. By the end of the year, he has more control over the pitch’s action, and in that last start with High-A Rome, he averaged 95.8 mph with the pitch. Both his fading changeup and sometimes slurvy slider took steps forward as well. The one knock about Baumann had been his inability to miss bats. But while he does lack a true out pitch, he did register a 30-percent strikeout rate from July 1 on, a harbinger of good things to come. The Braves are willing to bet on someone with his strike-throwing capabilities and think he’s perhaps just starting to unlock his considerable potential.

Toronto selected the 6-foot-3 Maroudis in the fourth round of the 2023 Draft and signed him away from an NC State commitment with a $1.5 million bonus. Maroudis was off to a strong start in 2024 with Single-A Dunedin but needed surgery to address his right UCL with an internal brace in late May. Until that surgery, Maroudis had as much upward momentum as any pitcher in this system. It wasn’t quite to the level of Ricky Tiedemann a couple of years ago when he made his big jump, but it was getting there. The surgery was a setback, yes, but Maroudis is still just 20 years old with plenty of development time ahead of him. That's important to note with his pair of fastballs sitting only 89-91 mph following the surgery. He's gone his mid-80s slider a ton for whiffs, and his 78-80 mph curveball gives him another quality breaking ball. The control simply hasn't been there in his return with more walks than strikeouts at times. The Jays prefer to focus on the fact that Maroudis is getting in any work at all against Minor League batters after the lost 2024, and with a full healthy offseason to prepare, there is hope Maroudis could look much more like himself in 2026 and beyond.

The puts his likely return date at some point mid-season, which could be enough time to get the hype rolling again. He had a 0.84 ERA with a 31.6/10.5 K%/BB%. The fastball sat 93.6 MPH, the curve and change got whiffs, and the slider induced weak contact. He also throws a sinker. He’s not the type I love taking the “Tommy John” discount on, but I think he’s worth a shot this late in the rankings as he was on a clear upward trajectory before going down with the injury. If he returns to full health, I don’t see why he can’t pick up from where he left off. Major elbow surgery is just part of the pitching prospect journey.

The Blue Jays selected him in the third round (89th overall) in the 2023 Draft before signing him to an above-slot $1 million bonus. Watts-Brown didn’t pitch professionally in his Draft year, but threw 103 innings between Single-A and High-A in ‘24 with a 4.72 ERA, 131 strikeouts and 60 walks. He was putting up better numbers across the board and had climbed to Double-A when the Blue Jays sent him to the Orioles for Seranthony Dominguez. Watts-Brown has improved his routines since becoming a professional and put on some weight, which has helped him hold up through a season. He has excellent feel for his low-80s slider, which will always be his headlining pitch, and his upper-70s curveball can be a whiff-heavy option too. But he could still benefit from some added juice on his fastball, which sits in the low 90s. Walks were a problem for Watts-Brown at times in ‘24, with a rate of 5.2 BB/9, but he was finding the zone more consistently in his second full season. Pitching at age 23 all year, the 2025 season has proven to be a big bounce back campaign for Watts-Brown. He should continue to get every opportunity to develop as a starter given his gains, though the Orioles likely know how much that slider could play up in shorter relief stints should he have to shift to a bullpen.

He might be known for a bigger number these days: 202. That was the 2023 fourth-rounder’s Minor League-leading strikeout total across all four full-season levels in his first pro season, thus becoming only the second MiLB pitcher with at least 200 K’s in a single year since 2011. He finished with a 2.76 ERA, 0.98 WHIP and .179 average-against, thus cementing his status as MLB Pipeline’s Pitching Prospect of the Year. The most noticeable change from Mathews’ time in college to the pro side was his added velocity. The 6-foot-5 southpaw’s four-seamer went from averaging 91.6 mph in his final year with Stanford to sitting in the 93-96 mph range in 2024. Whether it because of early shoulder trouble or the full-time move to the Major League ball, Mathews has seen that velo drop back again to the 92-94 range in 2025. His 80-83 mph changeup still well off that heater in terms of separation and 11-13 inches of armside movement, and even during the 2025 struggles, it remains at at least a plus pitch. A tight 84-87 mph slider gets ample whiffs against lefties too, while Mathews will flip in the occasional mid-70s curveball for a different breaking look. Some believed Mathews to have some of the best pitchability among prospects entering 2025, but his control has regressed in a major way this summer -- a trend that technically began during his first Triple-A stint in '24. Mathews still flashes midrotation upside, and optimistic evaluators believe he's still finding himself after being sidelined so early in the year. What's clear is that getting Mathews to Major League readiness is going to be more of a process than it appeared coming off his breakout first full season.

I’m not going to put too much emphasis on it either seeing as he was already at a career high in IP, and you have to give humans a chance to adjust to a new level, new team, new coaches etc …, but there is one wrinkle that makes me pause, and that wrinkle is that Triple-A is the only level to use the MLB ball. Every other level uses their own balls, and I mean, the ball is a pretty important factor. Blade Tidwell obliterated Double-A, got called up to Triple-A earlier in the season, and then stunk at Triple-A for a large sample. Everyone hates Blade Tidwell now. Mathews (and Brandon Sproat has a similar story too), didn’t have a large sample at Triple-A, so it’s easy to just hand wave it away, but I do think it’s something to keep in mind. Now just because I’m keeping it in mind, doesn’t mean I still don’t love Mathews. He’s a 6’5”, lefty with a mid 90’s fastball and two whiff machine secondaries in his slider and changeup (he also throws a curve and sinker). He dominated all season (other than at Triple-A) with a 2.76 ERA and 35.4/8.6 K%/BB% in 143.1 IP. And as you can see, he stays healthy, which does matter. I lean towards him being more of a #2 starter than a true ace, but add a star for his health, and he’s knocking on the door of the bigs. I like him a ton. Maybe I just feel the need to knock him down a peg because of my love for Tink, who I have ranked higher than Mathews, while most have it the other way around. The truth is, I love both of them (just Tink more ;). 2025 Projection: 6/3.98/1.32/97 in 100 IP Prime Projection: 14/3.59/1.20/190 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.2542372881355932,0.5677966101694916,0.11864406779661019,0.211864406779661,30.42,84.61538461538461,75.0,,92.15291750503019,3,0.75,78.52419380536614,47.256467831878155,1.0,0–1 yr,-0.5083334000000015,56.10000080000002,70.0,39.32294046956345,20.0,0.5599999999999998,Mixed,39.91532337130356,sa3023407,playerId

The Cubs picked him in the 15th round of the 2023 Draft and signed him for $125,000, then watched him pitch well for Single-A Myrtle Beach and High-A South Bend before trading him to the Rays as part of a three-player return for Isaac Paredes. Johnson kicked into another gear after that, posting a 0.78 ERA and 0.61 WHIP with 39 strikeouts and only four walks in 23 innings over six outings for Bowling Green to finish the season. Johnson is big and physical, standing 6-foot-6 and 205 pounds, but he has a short arm action from a low three-quarters arm slot. Still, his long limbs create a lot of extension, and hitters almost can’t pick up the ball until it’s coming out of his hand. His fastball sits in the 93-95 mph range and topped out at 98 mph last year, up from the low 90s during his time in college, and it plays up as a swing-and-miss pitch due to a flat approach angle. A mid-80s slider is his primary offspeed weapon, generating close to a 50 percent whiff rate in 2025. His changeup, clearly his third pitch, clocks in around the same velocity as his breaking ball, making him more susceptible to left-handed hitters. Johnson walked four batters per nine innings in college, but his control also improved as he got into the professional ranks. Last year, he struck out 120 while only walking 26 over 84 innings. And he did a remarkable job keeping the ball inside the park, permitting only two homers in 24 outings (13 starts). He already has the fastball and slider combination to be effective as a reliever, and even the breaking ball has been good to backfoot enough lefties to hold off splits issues for now.

He’s a tall drink of water at 6’6”, 205 pounds, and he uses that frame to fire that heavily used, mid 90’s fastball that is a plus pitch, to go along with a plus slider. He doesn’t have a third pitch and there is definitely bullpen risk, but let’s see what Tampa can do with a full off-season of him.

He pitched well down the stretch and held his own in an NCAA regional playoff game against Texas, prompting Houston to draft him in the 14th round. He raised his stock with a strong pro debut that included leading the Single-A Carolina League with 105 strikeouts in 81 2/3 innings before his mid-July promotion and ranking 10th in the Minors with a 30 percent K rate. Nezuh has significantly upgraded his changeup since college and now owns one of the best in the Minors, a low-80s cambio that plunges at the plate and confounds both lefties and righties. It has tremendous vertical separation from his fastball, which sits at 93-95 mph and reaches 97 with the flat approach angle and carry that the Astros covet. He needs to improve his below-average breaking balls, a sweeping low-80s slider and upper-70s curveball with similar shape. After not throwing strikes in his two years with the Seminoles, Nezuh has done a better job of harnessing stuff since. His biggest need is to find a reliable third pitch, and he has begun toying with an upper-80s cutter. If he can't stick in the rotation, his fastball/changeup combination could make him a late-inning reliever.

The left-hander flashed raw stuff to begin his first full season with Single-A Lynchburg, where he had a 4.67 ERA and 97 strikeouts in 69 1/3 innings, but walks proved to be a problem. Cleveland traded him to the Nationals as part of a three-player return for Lane Thomas at the Trade Deadline, and his numbers were much the same with Fredericksburg. Standing at 6-foot-6, Clemmey still gets low down the bump with good extension and can generate a tough approach angle that gives hitters fits. His 92-96 mph fastball plays up in the top of the zone as a result, and there’s plenty of projection remaining to get him more velo as he works through pro ball. (He’ll still be only 19 for the majority of the 2025 season.) He's also worked with a sinker in 2025 to play into his natural supination. Clemmey has gone away from a slurvier breaking ball to more of a sharper 81-84 mph slider that he can land in the zone or generate chase running away from lefties or in on righties. An upper-80s changeup worked well at Single-A but is the third-best pitch in the arsenal. Clemmey has an uptempo delivery that can be hard to keep consistent at times, leading to the walk rates. Nationals officials would also like to see him work on getting ahead in counts, and they believe an approach change could just as well correct some of his control problems. Clemmey has youth and raw stuff on his side to become a future No. 2 or 3 starter with the right adjustments.

Clemmey is a projectable 6’6” with a mid 90’s fastball, a nasty, bat missing breaking ball, and a developing changeup that led to a 31.5% K% in 92.1 IP at Single-A. The 16.1% BB%, 4.58 ERA, and 1.41 WHIP aren’t nearly as impressive, and shows there is a long way to go with a lot of risk for him to reach his high K, mid rotation starter upside, but like with Hader, Clemmey has a soft landing spot as a potentially impact high leverage reliever as well.

He was a little sharper in the Northwoods League that summer and showed off his premium arm strength back at school in 2023, leading the Phillies to take him in the sixth round. They were cautious during his first full season, sending him to Single-A Clearwater, but he turned out to be a revelation, both in stuff and his ability to command it, and earned a promotion to High-A Jersey Shore. When the Angels traded Carlos Estévez to the Phillies close to the Trade Deadline, they acquired Klassen along with Sam Aldegheri. He was pushed to Double-A and finished the season with a six-inning, no-hit, one-walk, 12-strikeout exclamation point. A 6-foot-2 right-hander, Klassen has always been able to throw hard, but he took big steps forward in pitch design and feel in 2024. His fastball averaged close to 97 mph last year and hit triple digits. His four-seamer had more ride up in the zone than it did in college and he also used a two-seamer with sink. He has two distinct breaking pitches, and both can be nasty when he commands them: a hard 86-mph curveball and a slider up to 90 mph. He does have a seldom-used upper-80s changeup. After walking 7.5 per nine innings in his final year at Minnesota, Klassen improved dramatically in keeping his high-effort delivery in sync in his first year as a pro. Even though the walks ticked back up post-trade, his final start of 2024 gives more confidence those gains might be for real. He has a higher ceiling than any pitcher in the system, but also perhaps the highest variance in outcomes.

Age for level isn’t as important for pitcher as it is for hitters, but I think Klassen is a good example for why it still needs to be taken into account. An older, more advanced pitcher can definitely have real advantages over less experienced hitters, which will make them look better than they really are. But the reason it doesn’t matter as much for pitchers, is that stuff don’t lie, and Klassen got that stuff. He throws a plus mid to upper 90’s fastball, which he combines with a plus curve and a potentially plus hard slider/cutter. The control/command is below average, and it’s not great how quickly he fell apart in his first taste of the upper minors, but it’s hard not to fall in love with that stuff. He’s a great proximity upside play with a soft landing spot as a high leverage reliever. – 2025 Projection: 2/4.33/1.36/61 in 60 IP Prime Projection: 10/3.79/1.28/182 in 165 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9152542372881356,0.635593220338983,0.6779661016949152,0.711864406779661,75.09,93.10344827586206,66.66666666666667,93.02325581395348,66.59959758551308,4,1.0,77.20587626265478,75.83055669192917,1.0,0–1 yr,-1.8194444999999995,71.833334,85.0,74.82366710757876,15.0,0.6799999999999999,SP,62.787316998410446,sa3023440,playerId

He wasn’t able to repeat his sophomore success the following year, but the Orioles liked the raw tools on the mound enough to take him in the fourth round of the 2023 Draft. He struggled in his first full season of pro ball, finishing with a 6.71 ERA and .280 BAA over 60 1/3 IP. Offseason workouts with Nathan Eovaldi seem to have paid dividends as he’s been throwing harder with better command during a strong 2025 campaign. A right-hander who topped out at 95 mph in his last year of college ball, Wells now possesses a fastball that averages better than 96 and has touched triple-digits, while it can have carry up in the zone or some sink down. He’ll employ a pair of breaking balls in a low-80s curve with depth and a harder 90 mph slider-cutter. He doesn’t use his changeup very often. In addition to throwing harder, Wells did a much better job of finding the strike zone in his second professional season, though he did miss fewer bats. Continued refinement of his command -- as well as a viable offspeed offering -- could give him the chance to start long-term, though his premium fastball and solid breaking stuff could be nasty in a bullpen role.

Given all of that, the Twins were thrilled with what he was able to accomplish in his first full season, using a very strong July and August in the Florida State League to finish with an organization-leading (among those with 70 or more innings) 10.6 K/9 rate and a solid 3.60 xFIP (fourth among all Minor League pitchers, 18 or younger, with 70 or more IP). He wasn’t able to follow it up in 2025 as a right triceps strain forced him out for nearly the entire season. Soto had made tremendous strides across the board in his one year of pro ball. While his workload was monitored closely last year, his fastball averaged 95.7 mph all year, according to Synergy, and elicited a 33 percent miss rate, with good deception playing a part. He added a two-seamer with a ton of movement that was very effective as well. Halfway through the year, Soto committed to throwing more of a gyro-type slider with depth, something firm, up to 89 mph late in the year that misses bats and he'll continue to focus on the shape and velocity of his breaking pitch. His changeup is at least an above-average pitch with fade. Athletic and with plenty of projection, there could be more in the tank for the Soto as he gets more professional reps, and he was sitting 95-96 mph in early camp work while going at 70-80 percent. He's a decent strike-thrower, which will get better if he can be in the zone more against left-handed hitters. That, along with continued refinement of his pitch usage could allow him to develop into a solid big league starter, though getting healthy will be his first objective.

But the Jacksonville native announced on Draft day that he would honor his commitment to Florida State and, thus, went unselected. Two years later, the Orioles took him 63rd overall, signed him for an over-slot bonus of $1.61 million and pushed him to High-A for his first full season. He was off to a nice start there before the Rays landed him as part of a three-prospect haul for starter Zach Eflin, and he turned in a dominant stretch to finish the year. Baumeister’s arsenal isn’t quite as elite as fellow Trade Deadline pickup Brody Hopkins, but he features a good combination of stuff, strike-throwing and command. He’s a fastball-dominant starter, using his heater more than half the time, and he throws that pitch in the mid-90s with good life and 97 mph in the tank if he needs it. But his curveball is his go-to out pitch, and it’s up there with the best benders in the Rays’ system. The right-hander has a starter’s frame, listed at 6-foot-4 and 224 pounds, and he’s got the makings of a full arsenal with a cutter-y slider and a changeup. It's a little bit challenging to get a read on Baumeister, in part because of how his performance fluctuates. He struggled to limit his walks as a reliever early in his college career, then he got them somewhat under control in the rotation as a Draft-eligible sophomore despite mixed overall results. He was averaging 5.5 walks per nine innings in Baltimore’s system before the trade, then only walked five batters in 29 innings (while, by the way, striking out 44 and only allowing 12 hits) with the High-A Bowling Green. A shoulder injury has kept him from taking that next leap in his first full season as a Ray. Last Prospect 26 T.J.

The Baltimore sample is bigger, so it’s hard to fully trust the control gains, but this wouldn’t be the first time a pitcher has seen big control gains with Tampa, and if he can maintain those gains, he’s a very exciting pitching prospect. He put up a 1.24 ERA with a 41.9/4.8 K%/BB% with Tampa, showing what he’s capable of when he’s hitting his spots. The fastball sits low to mid 90’s, but it can reach the upper 90’s, and it has great shape which makes it a plus pitch that can miss bats. The curve is a beautiful pitch which goes 12 to 6, and he also mixes in a cutter, slider and change.

That proximity gave Baltimore the inside-track at some early looks at the right-hander in 2023. They made him a 14th-round pick that year and spent over the $150,000 slot value for Day 3 picks to sign him for $450,000. Forret spent his pro debut making that look like a worthwhile investment, experiencing a velocity jump, posting a 28.8 percent strikeout rate as a 20-year-old and finishing at High-A Aberdeen. He built on that breakout with a 1.58 ERA and 91 strikeouts at High-A and Double-A in 2025, while working around lower back discomfort, and was traded to the Rays in the offseason in the Shane Baz move. Forret is a 6-foot-3 righty with a varied pitch mix and a lot of projection, but all his stuff is pointing in the right direction. He has two potentially plus fastballs -- a mid-90s four-seamer that touches 97 and a runny two-seamer. He has two sliders, with the sweeper the best of his secondary offerings. He also throws two changeups, including a kick change, and a splitter. It’s a deep pit of weapons, one that’s proven effective in this age of the pitch mix. Though Forret kept the ball in the strike zone relatively well during his debut, his control picked up even further in year two with a 7.4 percent walk rate. He’s still yet to throw more than 100 innings in a single Minor League season, clouding his ceiling somewhat. The depth of his pitch mix could make him a mid-rotation starter. It’ll at least give his new Rays coaches and coordinators plenty to work with in his new system.

Most notably, the fastball ticked up into the mid 90’s, and it turned him into a beast with a 3.88 ERA and 28.8/10.2 K%/BB% in 99.2 IP at Single-A and High-A. He has the starter’s build at 6’3”, the delivery is pretty athletic. He combines the gas with a potentially plus slider and a pretty good changeup. The control is below average and there is more refinement needed all around, but he’s the type who could really pop with a good showing in the upper minors. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 10/3.93/1.27/146 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9536423841059603,0.8675496688741722,0.814569536423841,0.9337748344370861,89.55,68.42105263157895,,,39.43661971830986,2,0.5,43.78644675067952,73.53275636273783,1.0,1–2 yr,-2.0138889000000013,74.16666680000002,55.0,82.43732692882135,25.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,59.18013047796961,sa3023479,playerId

Following a lackluster pro debut last year, he opened 2025 by throwing more strikes than ever at Double-A. He needed just nine starts to earn a promotion to Triple-A, a pleasant development in a farm system thin on pitching prospects. While Sanders' 92-94 mph fastball can touch 97 and is missing more bats in his second pro season than it did in its first, it's still not especially lively. His best pitch this year has been a mid-80s splitter that he uses as a changeup and employs against both lefties and righties. He also owns a pair of average breaking balls, an 82-85 mph slider that has been sharper in the past and a 79-81 mph curveball. Sanders' 6-foot-6 build creates natural extension and angle that help his stuff play up a bit. He halved his walk rate from 10 percent in his pro debut to 5 percent at Double-A to start this season, though his control is better than command. He'll have to locate his pitches well to make it as a No. 4 or 5 starter.

HS, Wolters became the Royals’ second-round selection in the 2023 Draft, signing for an over-slot $2.8 million and decommitting from Arizona. Wolters spent the rest of ‘23 pitching at the Royals’ facility in Arizona and made his pro debut last year, going to Single-A Columbia to start the season instead of being held back in extended spring training like the Royals have done with their prep pitchers in the past. Wolters was solid for the Fireflies with a 4.20 ERA across 14 starts at 55 2/3 innings, and the Royals shut him down in August after he had minor tendinitis and was nearing his innings limit. Strong and physical, Wolters stands 6-foot-4 and certainly looks the part of a starting pitcher. His fastball features ride and run, sitting in the mid 90s during starts last year, but he has touched 99 mph. That velo was down a touch in the early going of 2025 with him sitting more in the 92-94 mph range. His slider has the potential to be his wipeout pitch, a plus offering in the mid 80s that’s tight with hard break. He’s learning how to throw it and trust it more. Wolters worked on his changeup quite a bit in 2024, but it was up and down when he used it in games. That will continue to be a focus pitch for him because he needs a third offering to stick as a starter. With improved consistency, it has the potential to be above average. Wolters has a clean and efficient delivery, repeatable from a three-quarters arm slot. Wolters has the upside of a front-end starter, and he is extremely intelligent and advanced for his age when it comes to preparation and the way he digests information. But it will still take some time for him to develop as he works on pitch execution. He returned to Single-A for 2025 and was slowed after a shoulder issue in the first half.

Though he posted a 6.54 ERA in three seasons with the Raiders, his athleticism and arm strength ranked among the best in the 2023 college pitching class and the Dodgers selected him in the supplemental fourth round. After a strained left oblique and minor arm soreness limited him to 28 1/3 innings in his 2024 pro debut, he was one of the most impressive pitchers in the Arizona Fall League. Swan was at High-A Great Lakes for 2025 when Los Angeles traded him to the Nationals at the Deadline for Alex Call. While it looks like he's just playing catch, Swan works at 94-97 mph and tops out at 101 with his fastball while maintaining his velocity deep into games. His heater features more downhill plane than life and he has yet to develop consistent command of it, so it can get hit hard when he doesn't locate it well. He also can miss bats with two different sliders, one in the low-80s with more depth and a tighter upper-80s version that can climb to 90 mph. Swan also will flash some solid upper-80s changeups with interesting fade, though he doesn't use it very often. He's extremely athletic for a 6-foot-6, 240-pounder and works exclusively out of the stretch. But outside of last year’s AFL, he doesn’t have a long history of throwing strikes as a pro. Washington should develop him as a starter for now, but it's more realistic that he becomes an overpowering reliever.

He is arguably the best athlete in the Rays’ organization, including both position players and pitchers. And that makes sense when you consider his background. He was a two-way player at College of Charleston but didn’t pitch much. He transferred to Winthrop, where he played the outfield and started on the mound. His numbers weren’t great, but the Mariners took a shot in the sixth round of the 2023 Draft for an under-slot bonus of $225,000, eyeing him as a pitcher. He got off to an excellent start for Single-A Modesto last year then went to the Rays as part of the deal for fan favorite Randy Arozarena. Hopkins has the athleticism, size, delivery and stuff to be a front-of-the-rotation starter. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds, he has long arms and a loose delivery that includes a surprisingly low release point for someone that big and physical. That helps his stuff play up even more, including a pair of mid-90s fastballs (with a riding four-seamer and the ability to touch the upper 90s, plus a sinker) and a bat-missing slider in the upper-80s with a ton of break. He’s added a cutter and curveball to give him some velocity differential, and he rounds out his arsenal with a changeup that could be at least an average offering. Hopkins should be able to dominate hitters with his athletic delivery and full complement of nasty pitches, headlined by his fastball and slider. But he will have to display better command as he gets into the high Minors. Despite striking out 133 batters in 115 innings last year, he also walked 53 and hit 19 more. His walk rates have crept up a tad in 2025, but the rest of the arsenal is so good that he's become officially the best arm in the system.

He slings a sometimes unreal, double plus slider that is his calling card. He combines that with a tailing mid 90’s fastball that looks like he often has little idea where it is going to end up, and he rounds out the arsenal with a decent, lesser used changeup. It resulted in a 3.05 ERA with a 27.2/10.8 K%/BB% in 115 IP split between Single-A and High-A. There is definite control risk that seems like it will always be a part of his game with that funky delivery, so he very well might end up in the bullpen, but with a just a tad more refinement he could be a high K, mid rotation starter, and Tampa is a great team to bet on for that refinement. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 10/3.83/1.29/158 in 145 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7152317880794702,0.7019867549668874,0.32450331125827814,0.6158940397350994,60.82,92.3076923076923,90.0,,59.55734406438632,3,0.75,72.28275763176343,64.8319651711172,1.0,1–2 yr,0.20277769999999862,47.56666760000002,70.0,60.03558969133516,22.027776999999986,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,47.22518233110083,sa3023515,playerId

After the Orioles drafted him in the 11th round in the 2023 Draft, German didn’t make his pro debut until '24. But once he stepped on the mound, he looked like a different pitcher than he was in college, dominating the lower Minors in what was, performance-wise, the best pitching debut in the Orioles' system last summer. Though he faced mostly younger hitters, German still pitched to a 1.59 ERA with 90 strikeouts in 73 2/3 innings across 21 appearances at two levels, finishing the year at High-A Aberdeen. The 6-foot-3 German is a pitchability righty with four pitches at his disposal and plus command. He added velocity between college and his pro debut and now operates with a fastball that averages 92-94 mph and can flash higher. The best of his three secondary offerings is an overhand curveball that generated high whiff rates last summer, and he also has a hard slider and a splitter that he implemented in ‘24. German’s ability to mix his pitches and spot all of them consistently is probably his best skill and allows the entire arsenal to play up, while also hinting at an ability to limit damage against better lineups as he advances. German still needs to prove durability after missing time to minor injuries in his debut, but his collection of at least average offerings and relative polish give him the ceiling of a back-end starter if he can build up his workload.

He missed his junior and senior high school seasons following Tommy John surgery in 2020, then lost much of his Draft year at UCLA with a back ailment and the last two months of his 2024 pro debut to a shoulder strain. Finally healthy this year, he has worked his way from Single-A to Double-A. Though Tredwell's fastball sits at a pedestrian 91-93 mph and peaks at 95, it misses bats because his 6-foot-8 frame, high arm slot and carry create deception. Both his upper-70s curveball and low-80s slider feature good depth, play well off his heater and can be solid pitches at their best. He doesn't show much faith in his mid-80s changeup with fade. Tredwell's size creates natural extension that allows his pitches to get on hitters more quickly than expected. Though he does a good job of keeping his long limbs in sync, his control has regressed from solid in college to fringy in pro ball. If he can stay healthy and improve the location of his pitches, he could be a No. 4 starter.

That was Letson, who went to the Brewers in the 11th round but signed for closer to fourth- or fifth-round money with a $482,600 bonus. The former Purdue commit spent his entire first full season with Single-A Carolina and posted a 3.13 ERA with 57 strikeouts and a .195 average-against in 63 1/3 innings. The 6-foot-4 right-hander really gets down the hill with elite extension similar to fellow Brewer Jacob Misiorowski. Letson brings a pair of fastballs to the mound with a four-seamer and sinker -- the latter showing impressive horizontal movement -- and he’ll typically sit 92-94 mph and touch 95, already showing a bump from his amateur velo. His 79-83 mph slider gets whiffs with good sweep, giving him a second above-average pitch. His 82-85 mph changeup can get some chase out of the zone but sits behind the other two in effectiveness. Letson showed more willingness to go right after hitters the more pro experience he gained, and the additional confidence may only go with added experience in year two. The Hoosier State native has the individual ingredients (size, stuff, projectability) to be a potential mid-rotation starter in Milwaukee down the line, but a shoulder issue has held him back from a bigger breakout 2025 season.

He debuted in the pros a year later with Single-A Fredericksburg and was one of the Minors’ most dominant pitchers. His 39.2 percent strikeout rate and 20.8 percent swinging-strike rate were both tops among 551 Minor Leaguers with at least 80 innings, and he also finished with a 2.33 ERA, 0.91 WHIP and .167 average-against over 85 frames in the Carolina League. Checking in at 6-foot-6, Sykora starts his delivery with a big leg kick, getting his left knee almost up to his shoulder before getting down the hill with solid extension. After throwing harder as a showcase pitcher, the right-hander settled in around the 93-96 mph range with his fastball as a professional, and there’s hope he could add another tick with more pro strength training. It was good enough to buzz past Single-A hitters in the top of the zone in 2024, and a mid-80s splitter played well off it with low spin and sufficient fade. An 83-86 mph slider also featured enough drop to generate whiffs with break the other way, and it was notable that Sykora had near-equal splits against batters from both sides. The former Texas commit walked 8.2 percent of his batters, but part of his success in that department stemmed from getting chase outside the zone. More patient upper-level hitters will test that control. Sykora was slowed out of the gate in 2025 due to offseason hip surgery but took off once he made his season debut in May. Two months later, his progress was stopped again, first by triceps soreness and then a torn UCL discovered as part of an MRI in July. After undergoing elbow reconstruction surgery, he’ll likely be off a Minor League mound until late 2026 at the earliest.

All he could do was obliterate the competition that was put in front of him, and obliterate he did with a 2.33 ERA and 39.2/8.2 K%/BB% in 85 IP at Single-A. He’s a 6’6”, 232 pound beast with 3 at least plus pitches in his mid 90’s fastball, slider and splitter. He doesn’t have pinpoint control, but he throws the ball over the plate, and he doesn’t have the most athletic looking delivery, but it’s not unathletic either. Age to level doesn’t matter nearly as much for pitchers as it does hitters, but I do think it’s still something to take into account, so him being 20 years old at Single-A makes me want to see it at higher levels before truly crowning him. Regardless, this is easy ace upside, and his hype is going to blow up in 2025.

Selecting him in the third round (72nd pick) of the 2023 Draft, the A’s were able to snag him away from his commitment to the University of Florida with first-round money at $3 million. Getting his pro career underway last season at Single-A Stockton as an 18-year-old, he went through some ups and downs and posted a 6.55 ERA in 19 starts with 59 strikeouts and 36 walks over 57 2/3 innings. The A’s believe Echavarria’s stuff played better than the overall numbers might suggest. His fastball reached 98 mph and sat 95-96 with good ride up in the zone. The issue was struggling to command his arsenal when he would fall behind in counts. His mid-80s slider flashes plus, and his upper-80s changeup continues to improve. He also throws a two-seamer in the 92-93 mph range. He clearly dealt with some control issues, but the A’s are not at all sounding the alarm, instead patiently working with the teenager on adjustments. Echavarria profiles as a starter for the long-term with his 6-foot-1 frame and sound delivery. Previously having shown an ability to consistently throw all of his offerings for strikes prior to the Draft, he will continue to work to rediscover that control in his second season of pro ball.

When he showed increased polish on the mound as a New Jersey high school senior, teams began focusing on him as a pitcher, and the Cubs signed him for an above-slot $1 million in the fourth round. Tommy John surgery in March 2023 pushed his pro debut back to May 2024, and he has displayed some of the best stuff in the system but only sporadic control since then. Mule works at 94-96 mph and touches 98 with modest armside run on his fastball, which can straighten out at times and doesn't miss as many bats as his velocity indicates he should. His sharp mid-80s slider features more depth than sweep and can be a wipeout pitch at its best. He's in the early stages of developing a changeup, but it's too firm and has only sporadic fade. Mule has one of the more electric arms in the system but will need plenty of time to develop. He issued 42 walks in his 52-inning debut and doesn't get many chases because he often misses the strike zone by a wide margin. Chicago will give him every chance to develop as a starter, but he might be more of a two-pitch reliever.

They went almost three times over slot in the fourth round to sign Schoenwetter away from his commitment to his hometown Santa Barbara Gauchos. It took a while for the Reds to see what they had on their hands as he headed straight into rehab mode in order to build shoulder strength after the Draft, eventually making his debut in the Arizona Complex League. Numbers aside, the Reds were thrilled he was able to make 18 healthy appearances and spend some time with full-season Daytona at the end of the year. This will be the first year Schoenwetter should be able to show if he can start reaching his potential. He does have three excellent pitches in his arsenal, with a fastball that sat 92-95 mph last year, playing up with good spin rates up in the zone. He has more of a true, hard power curve, thrown anywhere in the 78-84 mph range with good depth, and his 84-87 mph changeup features good fade and he sells it well with arm speed. All three offerings might grade out as average right now, but all three could be plus in time as he physically matures and gets more reps. He struggled a bit finding the zone during his debut, but that might have been the time away from competition as much as it was anything with his delivery, which does have a little effort to it at times. He still has the chance to develop into a mid-rotation starter.

Houck went on to college before embarking on his pro career, but the Pirates stepped in with an over-slot bonus in Competitive Balance Round B of the 2023 Draft to lure Mueth away from heading to Mississippi. The Pirates often start their high school arms slowly, with time in the complex league in their first full season, and Mueth made a very strong first impression there, pitching his way to full-season Bradenton before the end of the summer. With a low three-quarters arm slot, Mueth’s stuff offers a ton of movement and deception. His fastball sat around 94 mph and was up to 97. It’s a four-seamer, but has two-seam characteristics, often with 8-9 inches of vertical break, along with up to 20 inches of horizontal. HIs mid-80s slider has a chance to be a true out pitch, a gyro-like breaker that misses a ton of bats, and his mid-80s changeup has a chance to be a solid third pitch with sink. There will be work ahead to add more depth on his slider and to make sure the changeup remains a viable option against left-handed hitters, but the biggest step Mueth needs to take in his development to remain a starter is to land his stuff in the strike zone more consistently. All of it moves so much that it will take time for him to harness it, but the Pirates are excited to see how he builds off his strong 2024 campaign.

He put up a 2.31 ERA with a 23.8/15.1 K%/BB% in 74 IP split between rookie and Single-A. The 93.8 MPH sinker keeps the ball on the ground and the slider is a potentially plus bat missing weapon.

The Dodgers, who signed the first Korean big leaguer (Chan Ho Park) in 1994, traded righty pitching prospects Aldrin Batista and Maximo Martinez to the White Sox for $1 million in international bonus pool funds, then landed Jang for $900,000. He posted a 6.14 ERA in his pro debut but lowered that mark to 1.47 in his final seven starts between the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League and Single-A. Jang struck out 41 percent of the batters he faced in his first taste of pro ball while displaying some of the best stuff in the system. He works with a 94-96 mph fastball that reaches 99 with good carry up in the strike zone, and he might have more velocity in his strong but still projectable 6-foot-4 frame. His tight mid-80s slider gives him a second plus pitch and he emphasized it last summer over his upper-70s downer curveball. His upper-80s changeup has been better than anticipated, featuring deceptive tumble. After a history of throwing strikes as an amateur, Jang issued 27 walks in 36 2/3 innings last year with a delivery that includes some effort and head whack. The Dodgers believe his issues were related more to targeting than mechanics and think his athleticism will help him improve in the future. He's a potential No. 2 starter if he can refine his control and command.

He was one of my top FYPD pitching targets last off-season, and while his control/command was too raw to say he was a major hit, he more than showed the upside that I just can’t resist. He put up a ridiculous 41% K% in 36.2 IP split between rookie ball (41.5%) and Single-A (39.6%). He’s 6’4”, 200 pounds with an athletic righty delivery that fires a mid 90’s fastball that can reach the upper 90’s, to go along with a 2 potentially plus breakers (slider, curve), and a developing changeup that flashes plus. He was improving as the year progressed with a 2.19 ERA in 12.1 IP at Single-A (6.14 ERA on the season), which is a good sign, but the 16.3% BB% remained high all year, and that is just way too high. He has the type of stuff that can thrive with below average control, but he has work to do to get to even that. The way I see it, the raw control gives you one more off-season to get in for cheap or possibly nothing before he really starts to pop. Last year was his first year in a new country and his first year in pro ball. There was a lot of adjusting to do, and I think he’s going to look a lot more comfortable in year 2. He’s a major target.

After dealing with a back strain during his first fall as a pro and then lingering shoulder tendinitis in the spring, Wyatt made his debut later in ‘24, appearing in 12 games in Rookie ball before finishing the season at Single-A Columbia, where he posted a 2.67 ERA across six starts, with a 23.6% strikeout rate, a 9.5% walk rate and a 1.37 WHIP. Wyatt is tall and lean with projection in his body as a young pitcher. His above-average four-seam fastball sits in the low-to-mid-90s with good life. He threw a little harder in high school, but there’s a chance for more velocity as he matures and gets used to the routine and schedule of pro ball. His 82-84 mph slider is plus with sweeping action that gets a good amount of chase. Wyatt is developing a changeup which sits 83-85 mph and has a chance to be average, and he also has a cutter in his back pocket that he might develop as a pitch he can throw for strikes and use against lefties. He releases from a low three-quarters slot and usually throws strikes. Like many high school pitchers out of the Draft, there’s no rush for Wyatt’s development, and the Royals are pleased with how he finished last year. There’s a lot to dream on with him, and they’ll continue to develop him as a starter. Wyatt will likely return to Columbia to begin ‘25 but could make his way to High-A by the end of the year.

In 2023, his hometown team drafted him in the fifth round and signed him away from a Florida State commitment for $847,500. Harrison, a high school teammate of Phillies prospect Aidan Miller at Mitchell High, didn’t make his professional debut until last year, but he showed a tremendous amount of potential and a surprising amount of polish for such a young pitcher. Harrison pitched well in the Florida Complex League to begin his first partial season, recording a 3.58 ERA with 39 strikeouts in 32 2/3 innings. And he finished just as strong, putting together a 3.15 ERA with 48 strikeouts in 40 innings during Single-A Charleston’s postseason push. By some evaluations, the 18-year-old Harrison was the best playoff starter in a rotation that also included Santiago Suarez and Gary Gill Hill. The 6-foot-4 right-hander’s fastball sat at 94-96 mph in the postseason series and touched 98. His heater averaged 95 mph on the season, and he throws it with impressive life up in the zone. His changeup is already a solid offering and could improve further as a weapon against left-handed hitters. His slider was also an effective secondary pitch, although he did most of his work with his heater. The Rays have credited Harrison for being fearless on the mound and attacking hitters, displaying confidence beyond his years. He’ll need to keep his control in check, as his walk rate ticked up against tougher competition in Single-A, but he has the ability to climb as high as any pitcher in the Rays’ pipeline.

The Cubs selected him in the supplemental second round in 2023 and signed him for a well-over-slot $1,401,500. He returned to the mound last year and reached High-A in his pro debut, and he has emerged as the system's best pitching prospect in 2025. Wiggins can sit at 96-97 mph deep into games and reach triple digits with his fastball, which features tough carry and armside run at times but can straighten out at others. He also can make hitters look bad with a mid-80s slider with two-plane break, though it has so much depth that it can be tough to land in the zone at times. His mid-80s changeup can miss bats with tumble at its best and has been more reliable this year. Wiggins is athletic and doesn't have any red flags in his delivery, yet he battled the strike zone throughout his college career and in his first year as a pro. His control and command have been better than ever in 2025, though they still need more refinement. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and has improved his chances of reaching it.

He broke into pro ball by logging a 0.40 ERA with 40 strikeouts in 22 1/3 innings in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League, then came to the United States and made one scoreless start in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League before thriving in Single-A. His combined 39 percent strikeout rate ranked fifth among all Minor League pitchers (minimum: 50 innings). Brito dealt with a stress reaction in his right shoulder that limited him to 49 1/3 innings at High-A during the 2025 regular season, but he dominated a pitching-starved Arizona Fall League, fanning 22 of the 47 batters he faced. The Rays acquired him from the Astros as part of a three-team deal in December. Brito gained about 5 mph of fastball velocity in his first year as a pro, working in the mid-90s and touching 99 mph with good carry up in the zone. His low-80s slider has huge horizontal action and projects as a second plus offering, and he also can spin a mid-80s curveball with promising depth. He has some feel for an upper-80s changeup with some depth that still needs a lot of refinement. The athletic Brito repeats his simple delivery with ease and threw consistent strikes before tiring toward the end of his pro debut. Only slightly bigger than his listed 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, he lacks physicality and will have to prove he can hold up and maintain his stuff over a full season's workload of starts. He has the ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and could become a high-leverage reliever if durability continues to be an issue.

He made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League, where he finished second in strikeout minus walk percentage (26 percent). After the Red Sox designated Cam Booser for assignment in December 2024, they shipped him to Chicago in exchange for Fajardo. Following an impressive first stateside season in which he quickly climbed to Single-A, Fajardo was moved again in December 2025, this time as part of the Cardinals’ return for first baseman Willson Contreras. Fajardo continually has added strength and velocity since turning pro, and he now works at 93-95 mph while touching 96 with his two-seam fastball and 97 with his four-seamer. He has a tight slider that ranges from 82-85 mph, and Boston is working with him on adding a sweepier version as well. He also has picked up an upper-80s kick-changeup very quickly, giving him the potential for at least solid offerings across the board. More advanced than most 18-year-old pitchers, Fajardo needed just six outings before earning a promotion to Single-A in 2025. He has thrown strikes throughout his pro career and commands his fastball well. He’s a potential mid-rotation starter and will be given plenty of runway to reach that ceiling in what is now his third system.

Mejia was one of the recipients, with the Dominican right-hander getting $150,000 to sign. He missed a ton of bats during his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League, joining fellow Orioles flamethrower Keeler Morfe among the leaders in K/9 (14.3) for pitchers who threw more than 20 innings in the circuit. He was having similar success with a move to the United States and the Florida Complex League in 2025. At 6-foot-3, Mejia offers plenty of projection, not that his current stuff lacks wow factor. He has the chance to have three easily plus pitches when all is said and done, starting with a fastball he cranks up to 102 mph that features plenty of arm-side run. He has a gyro-like slider that can touch 90 mph and miss plenty of bats, and there’s good action on a firm changeup that reaches the low-90s. The only things holding Mejia back are his command -- he’s walked over five per nine in his brief career -- and experience.

Mejia was one of the recipients, with the Dominican right-hander getting $150,000 to sign. He missed a ton of bats during his pro debut in the Dominican Summer League, joining fellow Orioles flamethrower Keeler Morfe among the leaders in K/9 (14.3) for pitchers who threw more than 20 innings in the circuit. He was having similar success with a move to the United States and the Florida Complex League in 2025. At 6-foot-3, Mejia offers plenty of projection, not that his current stuff lacks wow factor. He has the chance to have three easily plus pitches when all is said and done, starting with a fastball he cranks up to 102 mph that features plenty of arm-side run. He has a gyro-like slider that can touch 90 mph and miss plenty of bats, and there’s good action on a firm changeup that reaches the low-90s. The only things holding Mejia back are his command -- he’s walked over five per nine in his brief career -- and experience.

An infielder who pitched occasionally initially, scouts started to prefer him on the mound because of his arm strength and athleticism while on the hill. The Reds took him in Round 17 in 2023 as a pitcher, going a bit over Day 3 pick value to sign him for $225,000. Pitching full-time for the first time, he’s being brought along slowly, throwing 16 1/3 innings between the Arizona Complex League and Single-A in 2024, but taking a nice step forward in usage and results with Daytona in '25. A 6-foot right-hander, Ortiz’s athleticism and ease of operation point to upside he’s just starting to tap into on the mound. He can really pitch with his fastball-changeup combination, with a heater he throws in the 92-96 mph range that features some arm side run. His 84-89 mph changeup can be a very effective secondary offering and there’s feel to spin an 83-86 mph slider, with the cambio rating higher than the breaker. While Ortiz is still learning his craft, he has a loose and easy arm action and shows an ability to find the strike zone. He pitches very confidently and the Reds think he has starting pitcher upside as he advances.

He was primarily a position player growing up in Japan as a Japanese-American but moved to the mound in high school, in time for scouts on both sides of the Pacific to take notice. The move also came with injuries, and he needed Tommy John surgery around the time of signing. Aware of this when they added him, the Padres put Balzer into their rehab program and he finally made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Arizona Complex League in July 2024. The righty has opened his age-20 season with Single-A Lake Elsinore. With the elbow issues and rehab work behind him, Balzer captured plenty of attention on the backfields this spring as he touched the upper 90s. With a larger workload in the California League, he’s been closer to the 93-96 mph range with his running sinker bearing in on righties and away from lefties. His mid-80s sweeper is the whiff-dominant offering -- a breaking pitch that dives down with good spin and mirrors the armside movement of the two-seamer. He can display some interesting splitters, but those remain a work in progress, as evidenced by some serious righty-lefty splits. The 6-foot-1 hurler is still working on honing in his command as he finds his footing in the rigors of a full healthy season, but the individual pieces are interesting. His background means he has plenty of room to grow as he establishes himself more on the mound. There’s starter upside here, but if he remains a sinker-slider pitcher, he could land in the bullpen where the velo could really fly.

The Rangers loved his athleticism, projectability and delivery metrics enough to draft him in 2023’s sixth round and sign him away from a Dallas Baptist commitment for an over-slot $515,000. A strained lat delayed his pro debut until last July and limited him to 10 1/3 innings in 2024. Very much a work in progress, Scarborough can touch 96 mph with his fastball in the first inning and then top out at 93 in the second. If he adds velocity as expected once he fills out his lanky 6-foot-5 frame, he could have a special heater because his mechanics create a great deal of carry and armside run. He entered pro ball with a soft mid-70s curveball that needs more power, and Texas had him focus instead on a low-80s slider last summer. Scarborough’s effortless delivery creates a flat approach angle and elite extension. He has provided consistent strikes in his first extended taste of pro ball in 2025, though he barely has begun to dabble with a sinking mid-80s changeup.

That didn’t give them much to work with in their pool, so they traded 2023 12th-rounder Blake Dickerson to the Tigers for more international signing money and signed Cruz for $750,000 days later. A standout at the U18 World Cup for Mexico, Cruz stayed on the domestic side and made two abbreviated starts in the Arizona Complex League after signing. There’s a ton to dream on with the 6-foot-1 right-hander. He previously sat in the upper 80s during his international experience but was averaging around 94 mph with his fastball and touching 97 after joining the San Diego ranks. The pitch came with good armside run too, and Padres officials believed it could be a ground-ball machine when hitters make contact. His low-80s changeup fades well off that fastball, generating good chase and keeping left-handed hitters at bay. Cruz’s gyro slider has also improved, moving into the low 80s with decent spin. Cruz has an ease about his work on the mound, and he has the athleticism to pump strikes, even with the improved stuff. While other teenagers struggle to find the zone with consistency, his command should help find his footing with more pro experience. Cruz reached Single-A in 2025 during his age-18 season but needed to undergo UCL surgery (internal brace, not Tommy John) in August that should knock him out for much of '26.

The Mariners had taken the Wake Forest product in the third round of the 2023 Draft even though he had undergone his second Tommy John surgery prior to the start of the season. They liked his electric stuff and have not been afraid to bring injured pitchers into the system and rehab them, but hopes of another successful reclamation project were initially dashed when McGraw made just four appearances in August with more elbow trouble. When McGraw is healthy, which hasn’t happened often, he has a nasty power repertoire, especially his fastball and slider. He can throw his heater up to 97 mph and it features heavy sink. He backs it up with a slider that could be plus, a true out pitch with sharp break and his upper-80s fading changeup can be an excellent pitch as well. He used all three in his brief time on the mound last year, with the sinker and slider really standing out. As exciting as his stuff can be, he’s never fully harnessed all of his pitches at once, struggling with walk rates throughout his time at Wake Forest, though that’s secondary to trying to get him healthy for any length of time. He avoided surgery this time for his elbow and there’s cautious optimism about him getting his career going, this time with a move to the bullpen.

Occasionally, those bargains turn out to be pretty good. That might be the case for Cranton, who signed for just $50,000 in the third round of the 2024 Draft after a solid season saving games for Kansas. The right-hander was sent to Modesto for his pro debut, and after throwing well in the regular season, tossed four hitless innings and picked up three saves to help the Nuts win the California League title. His 2025 debut was delayed by a concussion suffered on a comebacker in Spring Training, but he was in the midst of dominating at High-A Everett when the Mariners traded him to the D-backs in the Eugenio Suárez deal in July. Cranton has all the makings of a big league reliever. His fastball has interesting characteristics in terms of ride up in the zone and it’s a pitch that sits 97-98 mph and can top out in triple digits. His upper-80s gyro-like slider can be a plus out pitch at times, though it flattened out and got hit at Kansas occasionally. The 24-year-old right-hander has a long arm action and moving parts in his delivery, which can impact his control and command. That improved with the Jayhawks in 2024, but it’s definitely a work in progress. If he can get to throwing more consistent strikes -- and early returns were good in that regard -- he could find himself in the back end of a big league bullpen.

Hayden hopes to be the next after the Reds took him in the eighth round of the 2024 Draft. He started his college career at Indiana before transferring to start for the Sycamores, where he had his real success, albeit with command issues. He made four relief outings for full-season Daytona after signing. Hayden’s best offerings are his fastball-slider combination. While he sat in the low-90s as a starter during his junior season, he’s already shown he can push his fastball up to 98 mph. His mid-80s slider is actually better than the heater, a pitch that elicited a 45 percent miss rate during his junior season, according to Synergy. He does have a firm changeup up into the upper 80s, but it’s a distant third pitch he doesn’t rely on. The Reds may let Hayden develop as a starter for now so he can work on his entire repertoire and try to refine his command after his 5.4 walk per nine rate in 2024 was an improvement from his first two seasons of college ball.

He emerged as the best lefty pitching prospect in the 2024 Draft, winning Southeastern Conference Pitcher of the Year honors, setting a NCAA Division I record for strikeout rate (17.3 per nine innings) and leading the nation in opponent average (.144) as a junior. Signed for $8 million as the fifth overall pick, his stuff and control have regressed in his first full pro season but he still has missed plenty of bats in Double-A. Both Smith's fastball and slider played as well-above-average pitches in college but haven't been the same in 2025. His four-seamer has dropped 2 mph, sitting at 92-95 mph and topping out at 97, and while his funky crossfire delivery and low release height create plenty of deception and carry, his heater often misses the plate by a wide margin. His slider has lost some power as well, parking at 81-84 mph with horizontal and vertical action, and it has caught too much of the plate and produced few chases this year. Smith can flash an upper-80s changeup with intriguing tumble, but he has lost faith in it because he has been unable to land it for strikes in pro ball. After he battled the strike zone more than ever and experienced elbow soreness this spring, the White Sox worked with him to slow his delivery down and keep him more balanced over the rubber. They still envision him and fellow southpaw Noah Schultz becoming their frontline starters of the future even though they have had more growing pains than anticipated in 2025.

They’ve done just fine with Chris Sale, Garrett Crochet, and Noah Schultz. The 6’3”, 225 pound Hagen Smith is next on that list with a three quarter arm slot delivery that he uses to fire a double plus mid 90’s fastball and double plus slider. Both pitches are whiff machines, leading to a 2.04 ERA with a 48.6%/10.3% K%/BB% in 84 IP in the SEC. He also mixes in a splitter, and while he doesn’t throw it that often, it’s a good pitch when he goes to it. The walk rate is on the high side, and it was worse in his freshman and sophomore seasons with a 13.4% BB% in 148.3 IP. Improving his control/command and turning his splitter into a higher usage 3rd weapon can turn Smith into a true ace. If he can’t improve in those areas, a high K, mid-rotation starter is within the range of outcomes (and I guess the bullpen is too, but you don’t take a guy 6th overall to use him in the bullpen long term). I’m surprised that Smith was allowed to debut in 2024, but Chicago marches to the beat of their own drum. He more than held his own at High-A with a 3.52 ERA and 21.2/6.1 K%/BB% in 7.2 IP over 3 outings. The filthy stuff was as advertised, and while the K numbers weren’t off the charts, it’s nice to see that clean walk rate. Add a star for being young for the class, but take a star away for already undergoing Tommy John when he was 16 years old. – 2025 Projection: 2/3.91/1.28/50 in 50 IP Prime Projection: 13/3.48/1.17/203 in 175 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.4635761589403974,0.8874172185430463,0.026490066225165587,0.44370860927152317,48.09,86.20689655172413,78.57142857142857,,91.34808853118712,3,0.75,79.62227217258928,59.12629526040625,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.3833334000000015,66.60000080000002,70.0,54.17738869812189,20.0,0.5799999999999998,Mixed,48.69982507415486,sa3025544,playerId

CC around Appalachian League pitcher of the year accolades in the summer of 2021, but he missed all of 2023 following Tommy John surgery after he transferred to Missouri. Though he posted a 6.58 ERA in his return to the mound last spring, the Astros liked his pitch data enough to take him in the 16th round and give him every dollar they could ($175,812) without forfeiting a future first-rounder for exceeding their bonus pool by more than 5 percent. His name began getting mentioned in trade requests after he made three Single-A appearances in his pro debut. After averaging 91 mph with his fastball during the spring, Mayer worked at 94-96 mph with explosive carry coming out of a low-release height during his brief introduction to pro ball. He creates good shapes on his secondary pitches as well, highlighted by an upper-70s curveball with downer break. He also has a sweeping 82-85 mph slider and a changeup with similar velocity and some fade and depth when it's on. Excited about the potential to improve the quality and usage of Mayer's arsenal, Houston plans to develop Mayer as a starter. To make it in the rotation, he'll have to do a better job of landing his secondary pitches in the zone and missing bats when does than he did at Missouri. He has a strong 6-foot-3 frame that should lend itself to durability and works from a three-quarters arm slot.

He posted a 3.23 ERA with 36 strikeouts and 23 walks in 36 1/3 innings for the Bulldogs in 2024 and went to the Brewers in the 12th round that July, signing for $147,500. Once in the system, Hardin showed enough to Milwaukee's player development staff to earn a starting look in his first full season, and he has run away with the opportunity, already climbing from High-A to Double-A in his age-23 campaign. It's better to see Hardin’s arsenal as a full package rather than a series of individual pitches. His fastball sits 92-94 mph and touches 96, giving it plum average velocity, but the 6-foot-2 right-hander gets down the mound well and buzzes the upper regions of the zone with decent ride on that four-seamer. Hardin’s low-80s slider is his best whiff generator, thanks to its sweep and his ability to wear out the lower gloveside corner with it, and he plays off that with a sharper upper-80s cutter he’ll throw to batters from both sides. Those are the main features as an 86-89 mph changeup is reserved only for lefties. Even against them, it remains a fourth offering. Hardin has spotted his pitches incredibly well in the early going, and that’s one of the keys to his professional success so far. The Brewers concede Hardin is on the older side for a first-year starter, but even without a true plus pitch, the 6-foot-2 hurler has earned more rotation looks in the upper levels.

He had an inconsistent season pitching in the Hurricanes’ weekend rotation, but the Braves liked his arsenal enough to take him in the fourth round of the Draft, then sent him out to get his professional feet wet with a few innings with Single-A Augusta and High-A Rome. While he’s just 5-foot-10, Hernandez could have the chance to be a left-handed starter thanks to a robust repertoire. At Miami, he had four pitches he could go to, though he might simplify it a bit at the next level. He has an average fastball that averaged just over 92 mph in 2024, topping out at 95 mph. His feel to spin breaking stuff really supports his heater, with his low-80s slider that missed bats at a 43-percent rate last year perhaps being the focal point in pro ball. He had a distinct upper-70s curve that missed bats too, though he didn’t command it as well. HIs firm changeup is his fourth pitch. For Hernandez to stick as a starter, he’ll have to improve that offspeed offering and cut down on the walks. Though he’s undersized, he’s strong and has the chance to be a durable innings-eater, though there is some reliever risk, with the chance of his breaking stuff really playing well out of the pen should that move be necessary.

He opened the year in the Trojans' bullpen before transitioning to a starting role for nine starts, and he finished his junior campaign with a 3.93 ERA with 46 strikeouts and 27 walks in 50 1/3 innings. The Mets took him in the seventh round in July and signed him for around slot at $281,300. Watson got two brief appearances with Single-A St. Lucie after joining the organization and returned to the Florida State League to begin his first full season. The 6-foot-1 right-hander has seen an early velocity bump across his arsenal in his first taste of the pros. His two fastballs sit comfortably 94-96 mph, touching 97, up from 93-95 mph in school, and the four-seamer plays especially well with better-than-expected ride from his three-quarters delivery. He’s added about 3 mph to his mid-80s slider and 2 mph to his upper-80s changeup, and both offerings have gotten ample whiffs in the FSL. They flash above-average, and the cambio in particular shows promising armside run. Watson has added an 89-91 mph cutter in pro ball, and while it’s gotten hammered, it at least sets up the longer slider and gives him another option versus lefties. Watson has some length in his delivery, and initial concerns about his control are what made him a reliever out of the gate with Southern Cal. He’s held walks in relative check early in 2025, even improving slightly after his promotion to High-A Brooklyn, in part because he’s gotten so many swings out of the zone, and even if he does need to head back to relief, the fastball alone would be intriguing in shorter stints.

He was ranked as the top prep arm in the class and ended up going No. 24 overall, signing with the Braves for just over $3.56 million, full slot for that spot in the Draft. The Arizona native, who was a solid two-way player in high school, didn't pitch after signing. The teenaged southpaw has a potential four-pitch mix with a ton of projection. He can touch 98 mph with his fastball and sat 93-95 mph in his final year of high school ball, with more consistent velocity to come. It features good ride and carry up in the zone and is thrown with some deception, so it misses bats, and he can command the heater pretty well. His breaking stuff can run into each other at times because he doesn't always finish the offerings well. But at his best, he does have a distinct slider and curve, though it might be possible he focuses on just the slider as he gets going in his pro career. His changeup took a big step forward in 2024, and it should be at least above-average for him. Caminiti was a center fielder when he was a position player, and his athleticism enables him to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone. There's a lot of ceiling here as he focuses on pitching only for the first time, with the potential to develop into a very good big league starter.

He has baseball bloodlines as the nephew of Ken Caminiti, he got drafted into one of the best pitching development organizations in baseball, and he’s young for his class. He’s not just narrative though, he has a strong foundation for Atlanta to build on at 6’2”, 205 pounds with a mid 90’s fastball that is a whiff machine and has double plus potential. The secondaries aren’t as refined, but he has a traditional starters pitch mix (slider, curve, change), and he also looked really good in his pro debut. He went 3 IP with 3 hits, 1 ER and a 4/0 K/BB at Single-A. The fastball sat low to mid 90’s and the slider looked good. He threw the ball over the plate. I think #2/3 starter upside is fair to put on him right now, but he’s so young with so much development time ahead, his range of outcomes is wide. – ETA: 2027 Prime Projection: 12/3.71/1.18/190 in 180 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.9340659340659341,0.8241758241758241,0.7032967032967032,0.9120879120879121,84.86,100.0,90.0,100.0,64.1851106639839,4,1.0,84.96478873239437,84.89667605633802,1.0,2–4 yr,-1.8527777999999984,72.23333359999998,85.0,82.97700285690141,15.0,0.6099999999999999,Mixed,66.53631800560564,sa3025607,playerId

The Mets selected the right-hander in the eighth round of the 2024 Draft and signed him for below slot at $172,500. In his first full season, Lambert has moved quickly as expected, first zooming out of High-A Brooklyn after fanning 17 in eight innings there and then holding his own in Double-A after a late April arrival. Lambert thrives on throwing the ball hard and is a self-described “adrenaline guy.” His four-seamer sits 95-98 mph with tremendous spin and carry, leading to a ton of whiffs up in the zone. He’s touched 99 mph this season but has run it up to as high as 102 in the past. Lambert also sports an 85-88 mph slider that darts hard down and gloveside, keeping hitters from sitting on the high heat. The former Sooners reliever lacks a third pitch and has the expected righty-lefty splits one would associate with his two-pitch mix. Also as expected for such a hard thrower, he can have difficulties finding the zone, and Double-A batters have been much less forgiving to this point. Still, a few tweaks to find the zone more regularly and maintain this level of stuff give Lambert high-leverage upside.

Following an All-America sophomore season, he entered 2024 as a consensus first-rounder before all four of his pitches and his control regressed. The Pirates drafted him in the third round, then sent him to the Guardians five months later as part of a package for Spencer Horwitz. At his best, Hartle exhibits advanced feel for a plus slider, solid cutter and average fastball and changeup. His heater sat at 89-92 mph and topped out at 94 with less life and command last spring, and he became reluctant to throw it when it got pounded. His low-80s slider and upper-80s cutter weren't as sharp as in the past, and his sinking mid-80s changeup rarely landed in the zone. As a sophomore, Hartle used his athleticism to repeat his easy delivery and spot his pitches wherever he wanted. Diminished stuff with less command was a recipe for disaster in 2024, when he also gave up four runs and recorded just five outs in his lone pro outing. He once looked like a lock to be at least a No. 4 starter with the upside of a No. 2, and now he's a reclamation project for an organization renowned for its ability to develop pitching.

High's 2021 pitching staff featured two arms who would go early in the 2024 Draft -- Blue Jays first-rounder Trey Yesavage and Astros fifth-rounder Hertzler. A two-way player in his first two college seasons at Liberty, Hertzler became the Flames' No. 1 starter when he focused on the mound last spring. His pro debut consisted of two brief appearances at Single-A. In his lone season as a college starter, Hertzler showed the ability to get chases and miss bats with four average pitches. His fastball operates at 91-94 mph and touches 97 with carry and armside run, and it could become a solid offering if he finds more velocity. His fading low-80s changeup is his best secondary pitch, followed by a tight mid-80s slider with occasional depth and a low-80s curveball. Hertzler's strong 6-foot-4 frame and high arm slot created a higher release point than hitters are accustomed to. As he got regular innings in 2024, he did a good job of cleaning up his delivery and providing strikes. He has more untapped potential than most college pitchers and could develop into a No. 4 or 5 starter.

The Mets still took him in the 13th round that summer and signed him for $125,000. Ross needed another revision surgery on the UCL in ‘23 and didn’t make his pro debut until Sept. 7, 2024, before making up for more lost time in the Arizona Fall League. He’s been a revelation this summer, climbing from High-A to Triple-A as a reliever in his age-24 campaign. The 6-foot-5 right-hander brings a ton of heat with a four-seamer he’s run up to 102 mph this season but generally sits around 96-99. He generates seven feet of extension as well, putting that fastball right on top of hitters and giving them little time to react. Ross has thrown his 88-91 mph splitter more than his fastball in the early going at Triple-A, and that’s true to both righties and lefties. It’s a real spin killer below 900 rpm and mirrors the slight armside movement of the heater with 7-8 mph of separation and 16 extra inches of drop, making hitters look defenseless when they swing too early. A hard upper-80s slider gives him something moving gloveside, and he’ll flip in the occasional mid-80s curveball for a breaking ball with more depth. Ross is still finding his command as he gains innings coming off of both surgeries, and that will be a process that could extend beyond his impending Major League debut. The velocity and extension will always give him a shot at blowing by hitters in a bullpen role, so long as he can keep this healthy streak going.

He had opened eyes by touching the upper 90s at the very start of his senior season but did not keep that kind of velocity up all year. He did head to the Draft combine and hit 96 mph during his brief outing. The Braves, never one to shy away from high-ceiling prep arms, took him in the sixth round and were able to keep him from heading to Mizzou by giving him $822,500, third-round money. For most of his senior season, the 6-foot-4, 230-pound Bagwell sat 89-94 mph with his fastball with decent carry up in the zone. His secondary stuff isn’t as consistently effective, with his 78-82 mph sweeping slider the best of his options. His upper-80s changeup is too firm, and like with many prep arms, he hasn’t thrown it a lot nor does he trust it much. Bagwell’s delivery does have some effort to it and that has led to command and control issues at times, even when pitching out of the stretch full time. He doesn’t offer much projection to his frame, but he’s more physical than many high schoolers, giving him upside to go along with some reliever risk.

He won the national championship with the Volunteers in 2024, followed by the Royals selecting him in the third round that summer and signing him for $1,097,500. Beam was largely considered one of the most polished and consistent starters in the college ranks. He made his unofficial pro debut in the Royals’ fall instructional league at the end of ‘24 but will head to affiliate ball this year. An effective strikethrower, Beam is all about his control. His mix plays up because of it, and he was good at limiting walks in college. Beam’s average-to-plus heater is 93-95 mph with good carry, helped along by the deceptive nature of his delivery and arm action. His mid-80s changeup has fading action to it, working well off his fastball with a chance to be a plus pitch. And Beam’s breaking ball is an upper-70s to low-80s curveball with good depth. He mixes in an upper-80s cutter that’s still a developing pitch. Beam’s delivery is clean and repeatable. His pitchability stands out, and he understands his arsenal and how to mix it even without a ton of swing-and-miss in his game. For someone just beginning his pro career -- even as a college starter -- Beam is advanced and mature, and he should be ready for High-A right away in 2025. He has a high floor and could move quickly if his control translates to the next level. With average stuff right now, Beam’s ceiling is more limited, but he’s a good bet as a fourth or fifth starter, even more so if his stuff ticks up at all in pro ball.

Plus control is his best attribute, putting up a 6.5% BB% in his 262.2 IP college career in the SEC, and he was throwing strikes the second he stepped on campus as a freshman. He also most certainly looks the part at an athletic 6’4′, 208 pounds. The career 3.60 ERA and 22.7% K% isn’t as impressive as the size and walk rates, and his stuff is more in the average to above average category than truly standout with two 94 MPH fastballs, a curve and a changeup. It’s a #4 upside type profile, as you can see from falling to 76th overall in the draft, and the lack of strikeouts subdues his upside for fantasy too. The deeper the league, the more value he has.

After redshirting in football as a freshman and not getting that much playing time as a wide receiver for the Hawkeyes as a sophomore, he left the gridiron behind to focus on pitching as a junior. He shook off a slow start in 2024 after what evaluators felt was too much tinkering by the program with his mechanics and pitches, making his own adjustments and finishing very strongly. With stuff as electric as anyone in the class, his command issues likely pushed him out of the first round, but the Rockies leapt at the chance to take him No. 38 overall. Brecht’s fastball and slider combination are downright nasty when he’s locked in. His fastball sits in the 96-99 mph range and he touches triple digits. It can have good running action to it, though he struggles to locate it and it can straighten out. His slider is virtually unhittable, thrown up to 91 mph with a lot of horizontal and vertical action, eliciting a 56 percent miss rate last year. He doesn’t throw his low-90s splitter very often and he doesn’t have great feel for it. The biggest hurdle for Brecht to clear will be his command and control, as he left Iowa with a career 6.8 BB/9 mark. The cause for optimism on that front -- fueling the belief that he can develop into being a mid-rotation starter -- is that he’s a premium athlete and is committed to being more than just a pure thrower. There’s reliever risk for sure, but he could also take a huge step forward with more insightful instruction.

We all already knew he was a really good prospect (granted, he’s been better than really good, he’s been great), but it was Coors Field that is the looming problem that he’s yet to truly conquer. Either way, Brecht was selected 38th overall in the 2024 MLB Draft, and he deserves to crack this list. He’s 6’4”, 235 pounds and is an elite athlete who also played wide receiver for Iowa. I’m gonna be honest, his delivery doesn’t really look all that athletic to me, and maybe that is why he put up a 14.2% BB% in 78.1 IP, which is simply way too high. The hope is that by focusing solely on baseball, that can improve, and he did have his best season after dropping football, putting up a 3.33 ERA with a 37.2% K%. The stuff is also legit with a mid to upper 90’s fastball, two heavily used, bat missing sliders, and a developing split change. The upside is very obviously quite big, but his control issues, and getting drafted by Colorado prevents me from buying. I’m just not in the market for Coors pitchers. It’s as simple as that. It’s hard enough being a pitching prospect, and I only like to roster a small percentage of pitching prospects anyway, so a Coors pitcher is just never going to be one of them for me. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 9/4.15/1.33/169 in 160 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8901098901098901,0.978021978021978,0.43956043956043955,0.9340659340659341,82.17,80.95238095238095,58.33333333333333,93.75,19.51710261569416,4,1.0,55.71491448692152,72.91072007042254,1.0,2–4 yr,2.011111100000001,25.86666679999999,85.0,70.94671604112676,35.11111100000001,0.6099999999999999,Mixed,48.83268892850704,sa3027632,playerId

Cortez had started and relieved over his three years, and he took off with a multi-inning bullpen role last year, dominating postseason play (1.18 ERA, 29 strikeouts in 15 2/3 inning) to cap off a very strong junior campaign. The Angels nabbed him in the second round of last year’s Draft and signed him for $1.6 million but didn’t send him out to pitch at all after his long year. Cortez enters pro ball with two plus pitches that really play. He actually threw his 86-92 mph power slider more than his fastball last year, and it’s easy to see why. It features horizontal and vertical action and elicited a 56-percent miss rate, according to Synergy. His fastball averaged a tick over 98 mph in 2024 and topped out at 101, thrown with power sink that’s extremely difficult to leverage. He has an upper-80s changeup, but it gathered a lot of dust on the pitching shelf. The 6-foot-1 right-hander generates those premium pitches without much effort, so there is some thought that he could be stretched out to start in pro ball. For that to work, he’s going to have to find the strike zone a lot more consistently (5.1 BB/9 last year was an improvement from 2023) and develop a third pitch. If he sticks in the bullpen and can be around the zone at all, he could zoom through a system in an organization that likes to get guys to the big leagues in a hurry.

He emerged as the Commodores' best starter in 2024, as his stuff and command improved and he displayed some of the best pitch metrics in college baseball. After New York floated him down to the 53rd overall pick and signed him for a well-over-slot $2,297,500 bonus, he'll make his pro debut in 2025. Cunningham works with a mid-90s fastball that tops out at 97 mph, and he learned last spring to more consistently avoid barrels by locating it up in the zone with quality carry. The shape of his heater plays extremely well with his hard upper-80s changeup that fades and sinks so much that it can be difficult to land for strikes. His sweeping mid-80s slider gives him an effective third pitch -- one that the Yankees specialize in refining. Cunningham improved his strength and athleticism as a Vanderbilt junior, which enabled him to repeat his clean delivery more easily. In turn, he provided a lot more strikes and maintained his stuff deeper into games. If New York can upgrade his slider, he could become the system's best pitching prospect.

He combines the heat with a slider and changeup that can both miss bats, giving him 3 legit pitches with bat missing ability. There is a reason the Yanks selected him relatively high despite pretty lackluster college production. He has a career 4.95 ERA in 160 IP in the SEC, and while 2024 was his best season, it wasn’t exactly dominant with a 4.36 ERA and 26.6/9.4 K%/BB% in 84.2 IP. The stuff gives him a high real life floor as a potentially impact reliever, and there is rotation upside too if he can improve his control/command and continue to refine his pitch arsenal. He’s not the worst option if you are looking for a college arm in the mid to late rounds of your First Year Player Draft, but he’s not exactly a target for me either.

The southpaw posted a 4.30 ERA with 117 strikeouts in 92 innings in his lone season with the Sooners, and he went in the fifth round to the Cardinals that July. He signed for exactly slot at $487,500. Davis hasn’t yet been pushed aggressively, but he passed his first professional test in the Florida State League, where he had a 3.26 ERA and 97 strikeouts in 69 innings before receiving a July promotion to High-A Peoria. The 5-foot-11 left-hander has added a tick of velocity in the pros, now sitting 91-94 mph and touching 96.9 mph with Palm Beach. The fastball comes with a combination of both ride and run, and batters so far have found that difficult to pick up, making it play better than the velo and below-average extension. Davis’ best pitch is easily his 80-83 mph changeup, which gets just as much run as the heater but has tremendous separation. Batters had a 62.2 percent whiff rate against it in the FSL, and the early Midwest League results are just as good. Davis’ slider works in the same velo band and has a gyro look with a small amount of gloveside movement, and he also works with an occasional mid-80s cutter. The former Sooner has run into bouts of wildness early in his pro career, bringing his future as a starter into question. He runs the typical reverse splits of a pitcher with a special changeup, so handedness shouldn’t be an issue if he does need to head to the bullpen. But with his K-heavy ways early, he should keep earning rotation looks.

He finally got a chance to start with the Bulldogs as a junior and started fast with a 1.50 ERA and 32/4 K/BB ratio through his first four starts. But a forearm strain slowed him for much of the spring, and he mostly made short appearances when he fully returned in late May. He helped his case with two dominant innings against Texas A&M in the SEC tournament, participated in the MLB Draft Combine and went to the Mets in the third round before signing for below slot at $797,500. After Dohm posted solid numbers at Single-A and High-A to begin his first full season, New York traded him to St. Louis in a big move for closer Ryan Helsley at the Deadline. The healthy version of Dohm utilizes a 93-95 mph fastball with impressive carry to blow past hitters up in the zone. He ran the heater up to 99 in shorter stints as a sophomore reliever -- a sign of what’s in the tank -- and he relied heavily on the heater throughout his college career. His 82-85 mph slider plays off the heater well, darting late gloveside to get a healthy amount of whiffs. He’s mostly kept his upper-70s curveball in his pocket as a pro, but the offering gives him a vertical option too. His upper-80s changeup is often too firm and doesn’t stand as a huge weapon against lefties, leading to splits concerns. Dohm was a tremendous strike-thrower in his two years in Starkville, but because of the forearm issues -- including more during his sophomore campaign -- evaluators hadn’t seen that control hold up over long stints as a starter. He quieted some of those concerns in the first half of the 2025 season before the trade. The lack of a cambio could hurt him down the line, but there’s still starter upside here given his ability to fill the zone.

The right-hander struggled in his first two seasons with the Blue Hose and missed most of 2023 with elbow and shoulder concerns before making up for the lost time in the Appalachian League. He was rejuvenated upon his 2024 return, winning Big South Pitcher of the Year honors while setting a school record with 122 strikeouts in 77 2/3 innings. The D-backs took him in the third round and signed him for $650,000, ending an 11-year drought for Presbyterian Draft picks. The 6-foot-4 hurler's fastball velocity jumped roughly 5 mph in his final season on campus. It sat 93-94 mph and touched 96 with good carry out of his high arm slot. He played off it well with an 80-82 mph downer curveball that contrasted nicely with the high heat and sported a 53 percent whiff rate in his junior year. His mid-80s slider was a distinct third option (and rarely used against lefties) but got plenty of swing-and-miss. He didn’t use much of a changeup in school and will focus on developing one as a pro. Eagen’s velocity trajectory proved promising, especially since he didn’t add effort to his delivery to get there. Bolstering the mix with an armside offspeed pitch could be key to his starting chances in pro ball, even if he continues to pound the strike zone, but the fastball-curveball combo would at least get him MLB looks as a reliever if its quality is maintained.

He had an uneven year that did include a record-tying 17 strikeouts in a nine-inning College World Series game in the finals against Florida. So far, the Reds are 1-for-2, with Lowder already reaching the big leagues. Floyd has yet to throw a professional inning following shoulder surgery in late May 2024. Given a clean bill of health, Floyd should be able to show the Reds what he’s all about in 2025. In 2023, his fastball had been up to as high as 98 mph, averaging around 94. It’s a heater that plays well because of its spin rates and carry up in the zone to go along with good induced vertical break. He hadn’t been throwing his low-80s slider for as long as his upper-70s curve, but it became more of a go-to pitch with good depth. He didn’t throw his changeup that frequently, but he showed good feel for the low-80s cambio. Floyd has a quick arm and a delivery without too much effort with the kind of repertoire that could fit in the middle or back of a rotation, especially if he can refine his command and land his secondary stuff in the zone more. His fastball and slider would play in a relief role if it comes to that, but step one will be for him to get through a healthy season, with the Reds monitoring his workload carefully in a first year after missing 2024.

He’s yet to pitch in the pros. I liked him as a FYPD college arm, but who knows how healthy he will be coming off the surgery. Here was my blurb for him before the injury: “ Selected 38th overall, the 6’2”, 200 pound Floyd has a plus to double plus mid 90’s fastball that he leans on heavily. It led to a 4.35 ERA with a 31% K% in 91 IP. There are more than a few heavy fastball usage pitchers who are doing well in the majors right now, but those guys generally have plus control and/or better secondaries than Floyd. Floyd’s control is below average with a 9.6% BB%, but it was improving as the year went on, and his slider, curve and change are about average at best. If the secondaries and/or control take a step forward, there is very real upside here, and I don’t mind targeting him at all as a later round arm if you focus on offense with your earlier picks.” … now with the injury risk though, he’s really more in pure flier territory, especially having to pitch in Cincy.

He worked his way into being one of the Tigers’ top relievers as a freshman, then was the only pitcher in their weekend rotation for the entirety of the 2023 season. He began his junior year as a starter but was moved to the bullpen, where he found some success as Clemson’s closer, saving 11 games, and he was taken by the Angels in the fourth round of last year’s Draft. He’s been given the chance to develop as a starter, making his pro debut this year with High-A Tri-City. Gordon does have a combination of size and repertoire to potentially start. The 6-foot-5 right-hander does have four pitches in his arsenal, though none of them jump off the page. His fastball sits around 93 mph, though he can reach back for 96-97 mph at times. In college, he favored his mid-80s slider over his upper-70s curve, though both can miss some bats and he was featuring the curveball more in the early stages of his pro career. He does have a mid-80s changeup, but he doesn’t go to the offspeed offering very often. Whether Gordon can remain in a rotation will really come down to his ability to develop a true out pitch and his command. He threw a ton of strikes over his first two years at Clemson, then regressed in his Draft year, and while he’s been around the zone at the outset of his Angels career, it’s been more control than command, and his stuff has gotten hit. A fastball-breaking ball combo out of the bullpen could tick up and let him move quicker.

Though he had internal brace surgery a month later, the Rangers still selected him in the fourth round of the 2024 Draft. They used him as a starter when he debuted in the Minors in June and traded him to the D-backs as part of the Merrill Kelly deal at this year’s Deadline. Hagaman’s promising three-pitch mix begins with a 92-94 mph fastball that climbs as high as 98 with plenty of carry and armside run. His best strikeout pitch with the Mountaineers was a tight mid-80s slider that he threw nearly as often as his heater. Considering his relief background and inexperience, he shows surprising aptitude for throwing a mid-80s changeup with fade. An athletic mover with a 6-foot-4 frame and loose arm, Hagaman gets down the mound well and creates plenty of extension. To make it as a starter, he’ll have to improve his control after battling the strike zone in college and in summer ball. He’ll also have to prove that he can hold up and maintain his stuff while handling a rotation workload.

After missing time in both of his first two college seasons with injuries, he stayed healthy in 2024, posting a 5.80 ERA but also a 35 percent strikeout rate. The third first-rounder in Crimson Tide history, following Joe Vitiello and Taylor Tankersley, he signed for $2,747,500 as the No. 26 overall pick and will make his pro debut this year. Hess can overpower hitters with a four-seam fastball that parks at 92-96 mph and peaks at 99 with armside run, and the flat approach angle and extension in his delivery make it more difficult to barrel. While his curveball sits in the mid-70s, it gives him a second plus pitch with its ability to fool hitters thanks to its depth and sweep coming out of a low arm slot. His mid-80s slider can feature two-plane depth at times but lost some sharpness last year, and he no longer trusts a fading mid-80s changeup that once looked like a potential solid offering. At 6-foot-5 and 255 pounds, Hess draws some comparisons to Lance Lynn, and his strong frame and clean delivery should translate into strikes and durability. But his walk rate jumped from 5 percent in 2023 to 11 percent last spring, and his health issues have included a stress fracture in his back in high school and a flexor strain as an Alabama sophomore. The Yankees excel at developing pitchers and believe they can help him regain the slider and control he showed in the past, which could make him a No. 2 starter.

Another strong campaign at his new school helped him move up Draft boards and land in Competitive Balance Round B. The Reds shut him down, as they often do with their college arms, rather than send him out for a pro debut last summer. His debut was delayed even further when he missed all of 2025 following reconstructive elbow surgery. While Holman may never light up the radar gun, the 6-foot-4 right-hander has a good feel for using his four-pitch mix to get outs. His fastball sat 92 mph last year with LSU, topping out at 95, but excellent command, ride at the top of the zone and induced vertical break make it better than its pure velocity. He throws his low-80s slider with two-plane depth for strikes, eliciting a 48-percent miss rate according to Synergy in 2024. His upper-70s curve and mid-80s changeup aren’t as advanced in terms of his ability to land them for strikes or throw them frequently. With his long and lean frame, it’s possible that Holman’s stuff could tick up under pro instruction once he returns to health. Because of his fastball-slider and his command of them, Holman has every chance to stick in the back end of a big league rotation. If more velocity or better feel for his other secondary offerings come, he could be more than that.

He put up a 2.75 ERA with a 33.7/8.8 K%/BB% in 91.2 IP this year. The stuff isn’t off the charts, but the low to mid 90’s fastball is a good pitch with good life and bat missing ability. The slider is his best secondary and it misses a ton of bats, and he has a good curve too. The control/command is about average. It’s not the most enticing profile, but it’s why he will be available pretty late in first year player drafts, and he’s not a bad option if you are looking for a fast moving college arm. It’s also not like he’s completely devoid of upside at 6’4”, 200 pounds, so there is certainly room to tack on a MPH or two on the fastball. I could have gone with any of the names in the just missed section over Holman, as they all have similar value to me, but why not highlight a fresh name rather than guys who I’ve been writing about for years now. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.12/1.32/128 in 150 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.7802197802197802,0.8131868131868132,0.5164835164835164,0.8021978021978022,73.44,42.85714285714286,,,19.315895372233406,2,0.5,24.756036217303826,56.40061267605633,0.225,2–4 yr,1.7361110999999987,29.166666800000016,35.625,61.687183822816905,61.73611099999999,0.567375,Mixed,31.457149430267613,sa3034003,playerId

He made his pro debut this April and joined the Red Sox a month later as the player to be named in the Quinn Priester trade. He ranked second in the Minors in walk rate (4 percent) and third in strikeout/walk ratio (6.0) in his first season, which he finished by posting a 2.39 ERA in six Double-A outings. Holobetz has added some velocity to his fastball since turning pro, now working at 92-95 mph and topping out at 97, but that's not what makes his heater so effective. He gets down the mound very well, creating extension and a low release height while producing significant carry and armside run, making his fastball difficult to barrel. His best secondary pitch is an average low-80s slider that features two-plane depth at his best, while his mid-80s slider and changeup are more fringy. Holobetz threw consistent strikes in college but didn't pound the zone like he did in his pro debut. He has the athleticism to repeat his delivery well while also providing deception. His floor stands out more than his ceiling, but if he can regain the more effective changeup he displayed at Old Dominion, he could become a reliable No. 4 starter.

Opting for the college route, he pitched in seven games for the Bruins in 2022 before sustaining an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. Shelved for over a year, he transferred to Louisiana State and pitched well over a healthy 2024, posting a 3.47 ERA in 17 games (15 starts) with 101 strikeouts over 83 innings. That standout sophomore campaign led to the A’s selecting him with their Competitive Balance Round B pick and going over slot for a $2 million signing bonus. After going through instructs, Jump is set to begin his first season as a pro in 2025. Jump’s fastball is difficult for opposing hitters to pick up with an arm angle that creates some deception. The heater sits about 92-94 mph and can reach up to 97 with good carry up in the zone. His upper-70s curveball has significant downer break, and his low-80s slider has cutting action. His fading low-80s changeup is used far less than his other three offerings. Listed at 6-foot, Jump lacks the size of a typical starter, though his growth since the surgery and ability to generate his stuff with arm speed helps his potential outlook as a long-term starter. The ceiling of a mid-rotation starter is there, though some scouts believe he might be better suited in a bullpen role. To start out, the A’s will develop him as a starter and look to see him maintain good health and strike-throwing ability.

He stayed healthy in 2024 though, and he showed why he was such an exciting high school arm with a 3.47 ERA and 29.8/6.5 K%/BB% in 83 IP in the SEC. He throws a low to mid 90’s fastball that is a bat missing weapon, along with 2 good breaking balls and a decent, lesser used changeup. He’s not a particularly big guy at 6’0”, the delivery seems a bit reliever-ish to me (not to say it can’t work in the rotation though), and there is still injury risk, but I don’t see why he wouldn’t move very quickly through Oakland’s farm system, and Oakland is desperate for impact starters, so the opportunity will be there. I think a #4 starter projection is reasonable for him right now. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.03/1.31/140 in 145 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.8410596026490066,0.7152317880794702,0.7880794701986755,0.8675496688741722,79.87,91.30434782608697,88.23529411764706,,38.22937625754527,3,0.75,63.40623854455149,74.10768349059302,1.0,1–2 yr,-1.0305555999999996,62.366667199999995,70.0,75.51580512717791,20.0,0.6399999999999999,Mixed,57.45544574723006,sa3034986,playerId

He headed to the Cape Cod League that summer and put himself squarely on the radar with a 2.52 ERA and 27 strikeouts in six starts (25 innings). The Wildcats made Kent their Friday night starter, and he handled himself well with the elevated role, posting a 4.08 ERA with 89 strikeouts in 86 frames. The Nationals selected him in the fourth round and signed him to a $625,000 bonus. The 6-foot-3 southpaw has a full bevy of pitches that can leave hitters guessing. He bumped up his fastball velocity ahead of the Draft to sit 90-93 mph, and he touched as high as 96. The pitch can play better than the velo too with a flat approach from a lower angle in his delivery. Kent’s 82-84 mph changeup is his most effective offering – one that works well down and armside leading to whiffs and groundballs. He has two different breaking pitches in a low-80s slider and mid-70s curve. The former was slightly more effective at missing bats in school, but the latter can drop in for an easy strike too. Kent had some control issues on the Cape but was much better at sticking to the zone with the Wildcats in the spring. With only one year as a starter against quality competition under his belt, Kent could keep building on his 2024 gains, but even if he’s capped at being a hurler with a deep arsenal but no true plus pitch, that could still work in the back of future MLB rotations.

It’s probably a back end or a reliever profile, but if he can develop the changeup, or improve his control/command, he could beat that projection. – ETA: 2026 Prime Projection: 8/4.18/1.34/126 in 140 IP",https://www.imaginarybrickwall.com/top-500-mlb-prospects-rankings-for-2025-fantasy-baseball-dynasty-leagues/,exact,100,0.5204081632653061,0.5408163265306123,0.3571428571428571,0.3877551020408163,46.77,,,,8.853118712273645,1,0.25,6.861167002012074,32.80190845070423,0.6775,2–4 yr,0.44166660000000135,44.700000799999984,31.9375,42.269072655211275,42.47916600000001,0.5670999999999998,Mixed,27.976707954845068,sa3037366,playerId

His time on campus was also marked by injury concerns, first with elbow surgery to remove bone chips as a sophomore in 2023 and then a rib injury as a junior in 2024. He managed a 3.41 ERA with 90 strikeouts and 36 walks in 58 innings, and the missed time and high walk rate likely pushed him out of the first round come July. The Mets swooped in to select him in the second round and signed him for full slot at $2,031,700. The 6-foot-2 southpaw’s 92-96 mph fastball comes in with a flat approach and impressive carry, and college hitters couldn’t much touch it. As if that wasn’t enough, Santucci also threw out an 82-85 mph slider with tough two-plane break that was a menace to batters from both sides; even right-handers whiffed on 56 percent of their swings against it in 2024. His upper-80s changeup may not have had much separation from the traditional heater, but it came with sufficient fade to keep hitters off-balance. The Blue Devils lefty wasn’t a consistent strike-thrower in school, but his athleticism as a former two-way player and overall mechanics point to a pitcher who could become average in the control department with more professional instruction. The southpaw has already reached Double-A in his first full season, relying on that fastball-slider combo to keep the strikeouts coming and keep his place as the top LHP in the Mets system.

He shows flashes of being a potentially impact MLB starter, but the control/command isn’t there and 58 IP in his career high due to injuries. The stuff is filthy enough to thrive without great command, putting up a 3.41 ERA with a 35.0%/14.0% K%/BB% in 58 IP in the ACC. He’s 6’2”, 205 pounds with an athletic lefty delivery, mid 90’s fastball, plus slider, and average to above average change. There is a lot of risk here, both injury and control, but he’s a high upside college arm who should come at a very reasonable price in drafts. I don’t mind him as a “let him come to you” target in drafts. Don’t reach.

But he blew out his elbow in a 2023 regional start and missed all of 2024 following Tommy John surgery. He did throw bullpens for clubs leading up to the Draft and the Braves liked what they saw enough to take him in the third round. Coming from his 6-foot-8 frame and high three-quarters arm slot, Sinnard does not give hitters a comfortable at-bat. While his fastball sat 91-93 mph before he got hurt, topping out at 96 mph, the heater played up with high spin rates and carry to get a lot of swing-and-miss. He has two distinct breaking balls: His 78-82 downer curve missed a lot of bats and his mid-80s slider with cutter action got more chases. His low-80s changeup with depth was a distant fourth pitch he didn’t use frequently. Sinnard did a nice job in 2023 in keeping his mechanics in sync despite his size and filled up the strike zone consistently. The 2025 season will be about seeing if he can get his stuff all the way back and eventually refine his command so he can reach his ceiling as dependable big league starter.

After a nice showing in the Cape Cod League, Stephen transferred to Mississippi State, where he posted a 3.28 ERA with 107 strikeouts and 21 walks in 96 innings. He signed with the Blue Jays for a below-slot $1,116,750 as a second-rounder, then raced to Double-A midway through his pro debut this year before getting traded to the Guardians for Shane Bieber. While Stephen's fastball operates at 92-94 mph and touches 96, it's most notable for natural carry that allows it to miss more than its share of bats. It plays well in tandem with a mid-80s changeup that features significant fade. His low-80s slider also misses bats, giving him a third solid offering, and he'll occasionally mix in a decent upper-70s curveball. Stephen has a physical 6-foot-4 frame, has added strength since turning pro and works with an athletic delivery that provides plenty of strikes. He has good feel for all four of his pitches and commands his fastball well. He may lack a true plus offering, but he has a high floor as at least a No. 4 starter and early returns indicate he may be better than that.

He’s a big guy at 6’4”, 225 pounds with good control of a good low to mid 90’s fastball as his bread and butter. The slider is also pretty good and he’ll use a decent change against lefties. It all resulted in a 3.28 ERA with a 27.9/5.5 K%/BB% in 96 IP in the SEC. It’s probably more #4 type upside right now, but I think there are multiple paths for him to bump that up to a #3 in a best case scenario.

He posted a 5.95 ERA with 15 strikeouts and 17 walks in 19 2/3 innings in the FSU bullpen but helped his stock with a productive move to starting in the Cape Cod League just before the Draft. The Nationals saw enough to take Tejeda, who was eligible as a sophomore, in the 14th round in 2024 and signed him for $225,000 ($75,000 of which counted toward their bonus pool). The right-hander has transitioned cleanly into the Single-A Fredericksburg rotation this season. Standing 6-foot-8, Tejeda moves smoothly on the bump and generates huge extension to get right on top of batters. His fastball averaged around 95 mph in relief with the Seminoles but has been in the 91-94 mph range (touching 96) with the FredNats. The extension helps cut down the decision window and helps it play above the so-so velo. Tejeda plays off the running heater with a low-80s sweeping slider diving down and gloveside that has his highest whiff rate, and he can morph it into a shorter mid-80s cutter too. Tejeda’s 82-85 mph splitter has shown nice growth in the pros, and it flashes above average with fade. The Florida native’s control numbers are massively improved in pro ball, though he relies on a healthy amount of chase to get there. Because of the new role and his age relative to other college picks, he’s been allowed to ease into the full-season waters in the Carolina League, and more disciplined hitters will provide tougher tests higher up soon. But for now, the Nationals have developed a legit starting pitching prospect from the back end of the Draft.

He became the Mustangs' ace last spring, permitting two earned runs or less in 12 of his 15 starts before the Dodgers made him their first college pick (fourth round) in the 2024 Draft. He didn't pitch after signing for $553,800, then headed to Single-A for his pro debut this April. Wright stands out most for his feel for spin, which begins with a low-80s slider that features plenty of sweep and can get misses inside and outside of the strike zone. He can turn his slider into a mid-80s cutter and also features a solid upper-70s curveball. Though his fastball is fairly ordinary, sitting at 91-93 mph and reaching 95 with some armside run, it works because hitters have to be aware of his arsenal of breaking pitches. Whether Wright will be a starter or reliever in the long run remains in question. His mid-80s changeup is too firm and comes with only mild fade, he's not very physical at 6 feet and 170 pounds and his athleticism never has translated into consistent strikes for any of his offerings besides his slider. If he does move to the bullpen, he could lean even more heavily on his slide piece and might emulate Bryan Woo and Drew Thorpe by going from Cal Poly to pitching in the Majors within two years.

Detroit pried him away from a commitment to Vanderbilt with a signing bonus just below slot at $1.75 million. He didn’t pitch in the Minors over the summer, but spent the offseason working out with Jackson Jobe at PitchingWRX in Oklahoma City. Hall relies heavily on a fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and reaches 98 with explosive life up in the strike zone and induced vertical break out of a high arm slot. With his athleticism and projectable 6-foot-3 frame, he could regularly deal in the mid-90s once he gets stronger. He throws two distinct breaking balls, with his low-80s slider showing more promise and getting more chases than his mid-70s curveball, which lacks consistency but elicits swings and misses. Though Hall barely used his mid-80s changeup as an amateur, it could become an average pitch once he employs it more and gains more velocity separation from his fastball. The Tigers have exercised patience with hurlers drafted out of high school, Jobe among them. That continues for Hall, who worked in only four starts for Single-A Lakeland before suffering a right shoulder stress reaction that kept him out of official games the remainder of the 2025 summer.

Schiefelbein was one of the more notable ones last year, a California prep star at Corona High School and seemingly headed for UCLA before Detroit selected him 72nd overall and signed him above slot for a $1,797,500 bonus. While Schiefelbein is neither physically imposing nor overpowering, he has an advanced pitch mix that hitters do not like to face, based around a low-90s sinker and two breaking balls. He used his mid-70s looping curveball more often in high school, flipping it into the zone to steal strikes and burying it for chase with a delivery that sometimes left him falling off the mound. His harder slider might have more potential as a swing-and-miss pitch in the pros with more deception. His low-80s changeup plays well off his fastball. Physical maturation will be big for Schiefelbein as he gets into the pro ranks, but his ability to adapt and adjust provides more than typical upside. While he could end up as the prototypical crafty left-hander, his grasp of pitching could create a hurler who outperforms his stuff. He's battled a shoulder strain in his first full season that limited him to only three Rookie-ball appearances.

Most liked him better on the mound and that’s exactly what Hunter Greene has gone on to do full-time in the big leagues after going No. 2 overall that year. Sterling approached his Draft season in 2024 without as much buzz as Greene, but did have a résumé of standing out as a pitcher and shortstop against top levels of competition. But like Greene, teams coveted him as a potential future starter, and that’s why the Pirates took him in Competitive Balance Round A and signed him for just north of $2.5 million. While Sterling didn’t pitch after signing, he’s already made a strong impression on the pitching development staff with the Pirates, who have seen some outstanding high school arms come through lately. Sterling doesn’t have the high-octane stuff like Bubba Chandler or Jared Jones had right out of the gate, but they didn’t have Sterling's pitchability, and he has the chance to throw four pitches for strikes. His fastball sits in the low 90s with ride and run, and he has a really good feel to spin two breaking balls, a plus 80 mph curve and a mid-80s sweeper. His changeup is also trending in the right direction and could be a fourth at least above-average offering. The athleticism that made him a solid shortstop really plays on the mound, with Sterling’s ability to repeat his delivery pointing to good command and control. He’s going to add strength to his 6-foot-5 frame, so there should be more velocity to come along with his feel for pitching.

I mean that in the sense that this could be like buying 2025’s top high school arm a year early. The last time I said that, I said that about Walter Ford, and Ford has yet to live up to that promise. So the downside is that the projection you are hoping to see never materializes, or doesn’t materialize on the timeline that you would like. What gives Sterling that projection is that he was very young for his class at 17 years old at the time of the draft, and he’s very projectable at 6’5”, 200 pounds with an athletic righty delivery. If the fastball can tick up from the low 90’s into the mid 90’s, he has a chance to explode with plus control and 3 legit secondaries in his change, curve, and slider (change is the best secondary).

As he performed well last spring, he steadily boosted his stock until the Guardians drafted him 36th overall and signed him for $2,569,200. He'll make his pro debut in 2025 and could move faster than most prep pitchers. Doughty stands out most with his precocious feel for spin, as both his low-80s curveball and mid-80s slider feature plenty of depth and can exceed 3,000 rpm. Both are plus pitches and his fastball could get there as he fills out his 6-foot-1 frame, because he already works at 91-95 mph and touches 97 with impressive armside run and command. He also shows promising aptitude for throwing a mid-80s changeup with fade, though it is a bit firm. While Doughty isn't very physical, he's a good athlete with a quick arm and a fluid delivery. He not only fills the zone, but he also can land his quality breaking balls for strikes or get batters to chase them off the plate. His intelligence is another point in his favor that could help him reach his ceiling of a No. 2 starter.

Projectability? Check, he was a teenager who already measured in at 6-foot-4 with strength still coming. Cold weather arm with work to do? Check, he hails from New Jersey. Family ties? Check, his dad Jeremy was a two-time Draft pick by the Dodgers and a Princeton assistant coach, and his uncle Justin was most recently the Pirates’ bullpen coach in 2024. The Brewers were the ones to take the right-hander in the second round in 2024 and signed him for above slot with a $2.5 million bonus; only Braylon Payne ($3.44 million) got more in the Milwaukee Draft class. Meccage has the stuff to back up the biography. He touched 95 mph on the showcase circuit, and he continued to bring similar heat in the spring of his Draft year. He has a pair of high-spin breaking balls in his mid-80s slider and slower curveball, and the former generally gets better reviews, though both can be solid offerings. Like many amateur pitchers, Meccage will need to work on his changeup in the pros to combat lefty batters. The righty has some effort in his delivery, and that’ll be worth monitoring as he enters the pro ranks. He could also choose to focus on one of the breaking balls, though Josh Knoth continued to throw two as a similar prep pitcher out of the Draft in 2024. Meccage’s future role will be revealed in time as he hones his craft, but the raw materials are certainly present for a quality starter. Last Prospect 16 J.D.

That’s when they took Hill, a super-projectable Texas high school left-hander. The best prep southpaw from the Lone Star State since Kyle Muller, Hill received an over-slot bonus of $2 million to sign him away from his Dallas Baptist commitment. He didn’t pitch last summer, instead focusing on building up and preparing for his first full season of pro ball. Following a growth spurt during his senior year, Hill now stands 6-foot-5 and saw his velocity increase thanks to his added size and strength. While pitching in live BP settings with the Twins, he was consistently 93-95 mph with his fastball, touching 96, in line with how he was dealing during his senior season. His low-80s sweeper is his best pitch, thrown with high spin rates and the ability to backfoot right-handed hitters. His upper-70s curve is a distinct breaking pitch with more depth and his changeup flashes average or more movement and should be a weapon, especially against right-handed hitters. The Twins will be conservative with Hill’s usage out of the gate as a high schooler who still could add a ton of strength to his long frame. They’ll want to see how his stuff plays against pro hitters before trying to change much in terms of pitch design, and it's more about getting innings under his belt while he refines his secondary offerings and focuses on repeating his delivery to land all of his stuff in the strike zone.

He took the summer off between those two campaigns, eschewing the showcase circuit in order to preserve his health following a heavy workload in ’23, and the move seemed to pay off. He stood out in the Super 60 Pro Showcase in February and continued his momentum throughout the spring. Evaluators believed he could sneak into the back of the first round, and that’s just what he did when the Padres selected him 25th overall in July and signed him for slot at $3,442,100. The 6-foot-4 left-hander showed improved velocity in his final amateur spring, pushing his fastball to sit 92-95 mph and touch 97 with good carry and armside run. His low-80s changeup appears to be his best pitch -- something not often said about high-school arms -- with significant drop as it reaches the plate. It’s something hitters have to constantly worry about, and that helps the fastball play up too. Mayfield also locates a slurvy upper-70s breaking ball well, but it doesn’t have standout shape and could be sharper. The former Oklahoma State commit repeats his delivery well at this early stage of his development, and his command was advanced coming out of high school. His improved velocity as a senior calmed some concerns among scouts who didn’t get to see him in the summer, and even though he’s already 20 entering his first full season, he still has plenty of runway to become a potential mid-rotation arm in the Padres system.

Given his age and physical projection as a 6-foot-4, 210-pound lefty, the Blue Jays were thrilled to land such a high-upside project for their development staff, chasing another early-career jump like Ricky Tiedemann and Landen Maroudis experienced prior to their injuries. There are years of development ahead for King, but his long-term upside rivals nearly anyone in the organization. King’s profile leads with his fastball, which lives in the lower-90s for now and touches 95-96 mph with good ride and run. His curveball is his best secondary pitch at this point, and it has nasty two-plane spin in the 78-81 mph range and projects to be a legitimate out pitch for him. King needs to develop a third pitch, though, which will be priority No. 1 as he works with the development staff in the coming years. He's very rarely gone to an 89-91 mph changeup, and that'll remain a developmental focus. A terrific athlete who was the best hitter on his high school team and could be a position player prospect if he focused on that, King does have a lot of energy and effort in his delivery, and not all scouts like his arm action. That’s why King’s strike-throwing will be key to watch over his early years as a pro, but all of the building blocks are there for the young lefty to develop into a mid-rotation starter down the road.

The top-ranked eligible prep right-hander in the class ultimately didn’t join Owen Murphy and Noah Schultz, recent fellow Illinois high school arms who went in the opening round in 2022, but he did get first-round money when the Mariners popped him in the second and gave him $3 million to sign. The Illinois Gatorade High School Player of the Year, Sloan will be making his pro debut in 2025 after not pitching in a game after signing. He already has an exciting pitch mix and an idea of how to use it. HIs fastball tops out at 99 mph and it sits 93-96 mph. He can play with its shape, riding it up at the top of the zone, cutting it in on lefties or sinking it for ground balls. His mid-80s changeup fades and sinks, and he has an advanced feel for it, while his low-80s slider is also at least above average with two-plane depth and horizontal action. While Sloan mostly threw bullpens after signing, he’s already made a good mark with his plus makeup, and he showed up for his first Spring Training in excellent shape. He already had a strong, workhorse-like build, using his size well for extension and a flat approach angle for deception. He can fill up the strike zone as well, and there are those who feel he could aggressively shoot up prospect lists during his first full season.

He developed thoracic issues while coming back from his elbow reconstruction, so he redshirted at Alabama in 2022 and worked just 3 2/3 innings the following year at the State JC of Florida (Manatee-Sarasota). He became the best junior college prospect in the 2024 Draft, leading Florida juco pitchers with 107 strikeouts in 74 1/3 frames last spring and impressing at the MLB Draft Combine before signing with the Red Sox for a below-slot $400,000 as a fifth-rounder. After his first full season (in which he was limited to 38 innings by issues with blisters), he was traded to the Cardinals in November in a deal for Sonny Gray. Clarke throws harder than most lefty starters, sitting at 95-98 mph and reaching 100, though his fastball features more downhill plane than riding or running action. He has unveiled a devastating slider this season, with the pitch operating in the upper 80s and touching 91 mph with huge sweep as well as depth. He has relieved heavily on his heater and slide piece, rarely using an upper-70s curveball and an upper-80s changeup with some mild fade, both of which he struggles to land for strikes. Still very much a work in progress, Clarke stands out more with his athleticism and quick arm than his polish. He gets down the mound well, creating a low release height with plenty of extension, but he lacks a smooth delivery and currently doesn't repeat it easily enough to have more than fringy control. He comes with a high ceiling and a good deal of reliever risk, making him an intriguing development project in his second organization.

For starters, he’s 6-foot-8. Secondly, he’s a left-handed pitcher. But he proved to have more than just those two attributes with quality appearances in the PDP League and Area Code Games heading into his senior year at Adolfo Camarillo (Calif.) High School -- the alma mater of 2003 No. 1 pick Delmon Young. Bateman joined the Padres as a second-round pick and signed for $2.5 million, roughly the slot of a selection 15 picks higher. He was more than holding his own during his full-season debut in the Single-A California League when he was sent as part of the huge package of prospects to the Orioles in return for Ryan O’Hearn and Ramon Laureano at the Trade Deadline. Scouts dreamed on Bateman’s size and praised his makeup as part of the evaluation process, but the stuff was plenty good too, and it’s shown up so far as a pro. He touched 97 mph with his fastball and generally sat 91-93 during summer showcases and has again been up to 97 mph during his debut season. He throws from a high three-quarter slot and has both a slider and more of a 1-to-7 curve, though he doesn’t really throw the latter breaking ball. He continues to work on developing his changeup, a pitch he didn’t need much in high school. Bateman improved his strike-throwing heading into the Draft, and while his history with walks isn’t perfect, his trendlines should get him to average control with advanced instruction, and he did a solid job of finding the zone in 2025.

The 2024 Draft provided another opportunity when they were able to lure Gregory-Alford, a big hard-throwing right-hander from the Colorado prep ranks, away from his commitment to Virginia by giving him $1.96 million (second-round money) to sign. Gregory-Alford had raised his profile on the summer showcase circuit prior to his senior year, threw well for Team USA in international competition and created a buzz by popping triple digits at the Draft Combine. The Angels didn’t ramp Gregory-Alford up for competitive pitching last summer, letting him mostly get some work in bullpens and at instructs. He’s very much more of a thrower than a complete pitcher right now, but he has two really interesting building blocks for a foundation. His heater can be fairly straight at times, but it gets on hitters quickly thanks to extension from his 6-foot-5 frame and he routinely can dial it up into the upper 90s. He combines it with a hard slider that could be a true out pitch in the future. He didn’t need a changeup against Colorado competition, but evaluators had seen one in the bullpen on occasion. While Gregory-Alford has a fairly clean delivery, he’s struggled to consistently find the strike zone when he speeds his mechanics up too much. Refining that and developing a third pitch could give him the chance to start long term, but he may be a bit of a project with patience required.

Kemp is trying to help that legend grow as he works his way through the Padres system. Ranked No. 209 in the 2023 Draft by MLB Pipeline, he went to San Diego in the eighth round that summer, signing for well above slot at $625,000. He was waylaid by shoulder problems in what should have been his first full season, eventually undergoing surgery, but he's returned with stops in the Arizona Complex League and Single-A Lake Elsinore this summer. Kemp is a physical presence at 6-foot-6 at just 20 years old, and it’s still all about the projection in his prospect profile. He uses a short arm action in his delivery, almost holding his throwing hand in place while the rest of his body moves around it on the mound. He hasn’t blown his 92-94 mph fastball (touching mid-90s) past many California League batters just yet, but when he does, it’s because he’s stapled the pitch flatly to the top rail of the zone. His slider has been his best whiff pitch after some modifications; it’s now an offering that can wear out the low gloveside corner. His changeup will flash promising fade, along with some firmness that keeps it fringy for now. Even after the lost time, Kemp hasn’t lost his ability to throw strikes at a decent clip, and he should be able to repeat his delivery all the more as he continues to add strength. The biggest purpose of 2025 was getting Kemp back on the mound consistently, and with his size, there’s hope he can build on a steadier foundation now that he’s accomplished that initial goal.

Are they just picking guys based on cool names? But Kemp is not just a cool name, he also cracks this list for potential at a projectable 6’6”, 225 pounds with a low to mid 90’s fastball that has he good control over and has the potential to be a plus pitch. He combines the fastball with good feel for a slider and changeup, but both pitches still need more refinement. His path can still take many directions, but plus control of a really good fastball with 2 solid secondaries and a beastly frame is a really good profile to bet on. I like Kemp a lot.

Trey Gregory-Alford got almost $2 million in Round 11 and they nabbed Jordan, a Florida prep right-hander who made the rounds on the summer showcase circuit, helped pitch his Viera High School team to a district title in his senior year and threw well at the Draft Combine, in the fifth round. To keep him from heading to Florida State, the Angels gave Jordan $1.25 million, close to end of second-round money. While Jordan’s stuff isn’t as big as Gregory-Alford’s, he does offer more polish at present and has plenty of projection in his 6-foot-3 frame. In high school, Jordan used a simple stretch delivery to fire fastballs that sat around 92-93 mph and touched 95, thrown with good sink. When he stays on top of his slider, which isn’t all of the time, he spins a solid biting low-80s breaking ball. There are makings of a decent changeup with some fade that could be useful against left-handed hitters if he commits to throwing it more. Some evaluators worried about Jordan’s longer arm action with a full-arm swing in the back and the fact that his delivery slowed down at times during his senior year, though that’s something that can be addressed with pro instruction. He tended to be around the strike zone even with those mechanical flaws, and it wouldn’t surprise anyone to see a few more ticks in velocity come as he matures.

After the Marlins were able to sign him for $235,000 as an 18th-rounder, he dazzled with his breaking balls in his pro debut this summer. He led the Rookie-level Florida Complex League with 55 strikeouts in 39 2/3 innings and earned a promotion to Single-A in August. Payne's best pitch is an upper-70s curveball with quality depth, and he also spins a solid low-80s slider with similar shape. Both offerings overmatched FCL hitters, though he'll need to upgrade a fastball that has ordinary velocity (sitting at 90-93 mph, peaking at 95) and more sink than carry. He's in the early stages of developing a low-80s kick changeup that dives at the plate when it's on. Working from a three-quarters arm slot, Payne uses his 6-foot-3 build to create extension. He has projection remaining in his frame, so he should add more velocity to his arsenal. His control and command are works in progress, but he has the upside of a No. 4 starter, and his ability to spin the ball gives him a backup plan as a lefty reliever.

He also excelled at the 18-and-under World Cup that fall and while winning Gatorade Iowa high school player of the year accolades last spring. The state's highest-drafted prep pitcher since 2014 (Mitch Keller), he signed for a well-over-slot $2 million as a third-rounder. Oakie featured one of the best sliders in the 2024 Draft, a mid-80s weapon with two-plane depth and plenty of horizontal movement. It works well in tandem with his two-seam fastball, which sits at 92-94 mph and tops out at 97 with considerable armside run and sink. He has begun to work on a changeup with similar action, though it was too firm in high school and he barely used it in games. While Oakie doesn't have an ideal starter's delivery and needs to provide more consistent strikes, he does have a quick arm and works with little effort. He adds deception with a flat approach angle that could be conducive to throwing a four-seamer with more velocity and carry up in the zone. His competitiveness and work ethic contribute to his mid-rotation upside.

Lebanon (Penn.) HS and was still just 17 on Draft Day when the Royals selected him in the second round and signed him for a $2.3 million bonus to pass on his commitment to Miami. A multisport athlete as the starting quarterback and top starting pitcher in high school, Shields' decision to quit football and focus on baseball paid off. He pitched on the backfields and in instructional league after the Draft last summer, so his official pro debut will come in 2025. Shields was around 93-94 mph with his fastball at instructs in late ‘24, and the Royals expect some more power as he physically matures. The pitch has some deception to it, helped along by Shields’ good extension. His fringe-average breaking ball blends between a slider or curveball depending on who is assessing the pitch, but it typically sits in the low 80s and has the potential to be above average with consistency. Shields has flashed a circle changeup with good armside fade, but that will be a focus for him in his first full year. Shields already shows good command and is a great athlete with a projectable body and a clean and simple delivery. His makeup is strong, and he's already growing into a mature pro and competitor. He has upside as a starter, potentially even a No. 2 or 3, and the Royals will develop him as such. They’ll manage his innings like most of their prep pitchers out of the Draft, but he's been tremendous out of the gate at Single-A in 2025.

He has a smooth lefty swing too even though his future is definitely on the mound, but it does show the type of athlete he is. You can see that athleticism on the mound with a lefty delivery that is easy to dream on, especially since he was one of the youngest players in the draft. The stuff isn’t quite as exciting yet with a low 90’s fastball and 3 still developing secondaries (slider, curve, changeup), but he throws a ton of strikes, and it’s so easy to project improvement on all of his pitches. There is definitely nice upside in here if the velocity ticks up and he refines the secondaries, but there is also a long way to go.

The Marlins paid Grant third-round money ($897,500) in the fifth round out of a Colorado high school, while the White Sox gave Blake $150,000 in the 11th round after he touched 100 mph as a Dons junior. Grant, who touched 98 mph after gaining 15 pounds as a prep senior, will make his pro debut in 2025. Added strength allowed Shepardson to add about 4 mph to his high-spin fastball, which now operates at 91-95 mph with carry and armside run. He also generates high spin rates on his low-80s slider, which shows signs of possibly becoming a plus pitch. With his 6-foot-1 frame and fastball/slider combination, he has elicited comparisons to Lance McCullers Jr. Shepardson also owns an intriguing mid-80s changeup that he throws with a Vulcan grip, and he can use an upper-70s curveball as a get-me-over pitch. His control and command are still works in progress, but he has the athleticism to provide consistent strikes as he continues to mature.

He was viewed as an intriguing right-hander from Newbury Park High School in Southern California whose raw stuff likely needed further development at the college level, but by the end of his junior season, an uptick in velocity and overall improved stuff led to him committing to nearby UCLA. It took an over-slot $1 million signing bonus as a 2023 fourth-round Draft pick for the A’s to move him off that commitment. He was set to make his pro debut in 2024 until an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery derailed those plans. After continuing his rehab this spring, he finally made his organizational debut in June. The A’s were working on some mechanical adjustments with Miller prior to his injury. His electric fastball ticked up to 96 mph in high school and displayed excellent movement down in the zone. The mid-80s slider is a hard breaker and was showing signs of improvement. His low-80s changeup showed some potential as an average third pitch. There was real excitement within the organization for Miller’s professional debut. His three-pitch mix and large 6-foot-6 frame give off the potential of a workhorse-type starting pitcher in the big leagues. The A’s also loved the competitiveness they saw from him on the mound while scouting him. After an unfortunate delay, he finally got his first opportunity to make an impression this summer.

Though Defrank’s $560,000 bonus paled in comparison to Salas’ $3.7 million, it was the fourth-highest amount given to a pitcher on this year’s market. His fastball hit 100 mph at the club’s complex in the Dominican Republic shortly after he signed. Defrank will pitch most of his first pro season as a 16-year-old and already is starting to sit in the mid-90s with his fastball, which features armside run and carry and has more projection remaining. He also has an extremely advanced changeup for his age, which has plenty of sink and fade and good velocity separation from his heater. His sweeping slider has added some power and comes with promising spin rates, though it lacks the consistency of his other two offerings. Defrank has an athletic 6-foot-5 build and moves down the mound well, creating extension that makes his pitches more difficult to hit. He has a quick yet repeatable delivery and should have no problem throwing strikes. He’s the most intriguing Marlins international pitching prospect since Eury Pérez and has the upside to eventually fit into the front half of a big league rotation.

That's the most Boston has paid for an international pitcher since landing Chih-Jung Liu for $750,001 in 2019. He was trending up at the time he turned pro with an impressive combination of stuff, polish and projection. Delzine already works in the low 90s and touches 94 mph with armside run on his fastball at age 17, with the promise of more velocity as he fills out his 6-foot-5 frame. His size and high three-quarters arm slot allow him to stay on top of his upper-70s curveball with downer break, and it also should add more power as he gets stronger. He has a tumbling mid-80s changeup that he sells with fastball arm speed, and assistant GM Eddie Romero said his cambio was one of the most advanced the Red Sox have scouted on that market. A quality athlete, Delzine has better body control than most tall pitchers his age. He keeps his long limbs in sync in his fluid delivery and should have no difficulty throwing strikes. He'll need plenty of time to develop but it's possible to dream of him winding up with three plus pitches and control to match.
